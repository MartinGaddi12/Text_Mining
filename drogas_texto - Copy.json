Last updated on May 7, 2025.\nUsesBefore takingDosageSide effectsBrand names\nUses for A/B Otic\nAntipyrine and benzocaine combination is used in the ear to help relieve the pain, swelling, and congestion of some ear infections. It will not cure the infection itself. An antibiotic will be needed to treat the infection. This medicine is also used to soften earwax so that the earwax can be washed away more easily.\nIn the U.S., this medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\nBefore using A/B Otic\nIn deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\nAllergies\nTell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\nPediatric\nInfants, especially infants up to 3 months of age, may be especially sensitive to the effects of the benzocaine in this combination medicine. This may increase the chance of side effects. However, this medicine is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in older children than it does in adults.\nGeriatric\nMany medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults. Although there is no specific information comparing use of antipyrine and benzocaine in the elderly with use in other age groups, this medicine is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in older people than it does in younger adults.\nBreast Feeding\nThere are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\nInteractions with Medicines\nAlthough certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\nUsing this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\nHyaluronidaseSt John's Wort\nInteractions with Food/Tobacco/Alcohol\nCertain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.

A sterile cotton plug may be moistened with a few drops of this medicine and gently placed at the ear opening for no longer than 5 to 10 minutes to help keep the medicine from leaking out. If you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, do not touch the dropper to any surface (including the ear).Do not rinse the dropper after use. Wipe the tip of the dropper with a clean tissue and keep the container tightly closed.\nIf you are using this medicine to help remove earwax, the ear should be flushed with warm water after you have used this medicine for 2 or 3 days. This is usually done by your doctor. If you have been directed to flush the ear out yourself, make sure that you have learned how to do it correctly. Follow the instructions carefully.\nDosing\nThe dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label.

(8.2)\nSee 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION.\nRevised: 5/2025\nFull Prescribing Information\nHypersensitivity ReactionsSerious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions, with multiple organ involvement, have occurred with abacavir, a component of abacavir and lamivudine tablet. Patients who carry the HLA-B*5701 allele are at a higher risk of a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir; although, hypersensitivity reactions have occurred in patients who do not carry the HLA-B*5701 allele[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1)].Abacavir and lamivudine tablets are contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir and in HLA-B*5701-positive patients[seeContraindications (4),Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].All patients should be screened for the HLA-B*5701 allele prior to initiating therapy with abacavir and lamivudine tablet or reinitiation of therapy with abacavir and lamivudine tablets, unless patients have a previously documented HLA-B*5701 allele assessment. Discontinue abacavir and lamivudine tablets immediately if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, regardless of HLA-B*5701 status and even when other diagnoses are possible[seeContraindications (4),Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].Following a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir and lamivudine tablets, NEVER restart abacavir and lamivudine tablets or any other abacavir-containing product because more severe symptoms, including death, can occur within hours. Similar severe reactions have also occurred rarely following the reintroduction of abacavir-containing products in patients who have no history of abacavir hypersensitivity[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1)].Exacerbations of Hepatitis BSevere acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are co-infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and have discontinued lamivudine, which is a component of abacavir and lamivudine tablets. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who discontinue abacavir and lamivudine tablets and are co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2)].\n1. Indications and Usage for Abacavir and Lamivudine Tablets\nAbacavir and lamivudine tablets, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, are indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.\n2. Abacavir and Lamivudine Tablets Dosage and Administration\n2.1 Screening for HLA-B*5701 Allele Prior to Starting Abacavir and Lamivudine Tablets\nScreen for the HLA-B*5701 allele prior to initiating therapy with abacavir and lamivudine tablets[seeBoxed Warning,Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].\n2.2 Recommended Dosage for Adult Patients\nThe recommended dosage of abacavir and lamivudine tablets for adults is one tablet taken orally once daily, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, with or without food.\n2.3 Recommended Dosage for Pediatric Patients\nThe recommended oral dose of abacavir and lamivudine for pediatric patients weighing at least 25 kg is one tablet daily in combination with other antiretroviral agents[seeClinical Studies (14.2)].Before prescribing abacavir and lamivudine tablets, pediatric patients should be assessed for the ability to swallow tablets.\n2.4 Not Recommended Due to Lack of Dosage Adjustment\nBecause abacavir and lamivudine is a fixed-dose tablet and cannot be dose adjusted, abacavir and lamivudine tablets are not recommended for:• patientswithcreatinine clearance less than 30 mL per minute[seeUse in Specific Populations (8.6)].• patients with mild hepatic impairment. Abacavir and lamivudine tablets are contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment[seeContraindications (4),Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].Use of EPIVIR (lamivudine) oral solution or tablets and ZIAGEN (abacavir) oral solution may be considered.\n3. Dosage Forms and Strengths\nAbacavir and Lamivudine tablets, USP contain 600 mg of abacavir as abacavir sulfate USP and   300 mg of lamivudine USP. The tablets are orange, modified capsule shaped, biconvex, film-coated tablets de-bossed with ‘H’ on one side and ‘A1’ on other side.\n4. Contraindications\nAbacavir and lamivudine tablets are contraindicated in patients:• who have the HLA-B*5701 allele[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1)].• with prior hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1)]or lamivudine.• with moderate or severe hepatic impairment[seeUse in Specific Populations (8.7)].\n5. Warnings and Precautions\n5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions\nSerious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with abacavir, a component of abacavir and lamivudine. These hypersensitivity reactions have included multi-organ failure and anaphylaxis and typically occurred within the first 6 weeks of treatment with abacavir (median time to onset was 9 days); although abacavir hypersensitivity reactions have occurred any time during treatment[seeAdverse Reactions (6.1)].Patients who carry the HLA-B*5701 allele are at a higher risk of abacavir hypersensitivity reactions; although, patients who do not carry the HLA-B*5701 allele have developed hypersensitivity reactions. Hypersensitivity to abacavir was reported in approximately 206 (8%) of 2,670 patients in 9 clinical trials with abacavir-containing products where HLA-B*5701 screening was not performed. The incidence of suspected abacavir hypersensitivity reactions in clinical trials was 1% when subjects carrying the HLA-B*5701 allele were excluded. In any patient treated with abacavir, the clinical diagnosis of hypersensitivity reaction must remain the basis of clinical decision making.Due to the potential for severe, serious, and possibly fatal hypersensitivity reactions with abacavir:• All patients should be screened for the HLA-B*5701 allele prior to initiating therapy with abacavir and lamivudine or reinitiation of therapy with abacavir and lamivudine, unless patients have a previously documented HLA-B*5701 allele assessment.• Abacavir and lamivudine is contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir and in HLA-B*5701-positive patients.• Before starting abacavir and lamivudine, review medical history for prior exposure to any abacavir-containing product. NEVER restart abacavir and lamivudine or any other abacavir-containing product following a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, regardless of HLA-B*5701 status.• To reduce the risk of a life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction, regardless of HLA-B*5701 status, discontinue abacavir and lamivudine immediately if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, even when other diagnoses are possible (e.g., acute onset respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis, pharyngitis, or influenza; gastroenteritis; or reactions to other medications).• If a hypersensitivity reaction cannot be ruled out, do not restart abacavir and lamivudine or any other abacavir-containing products because more severe symptoms, which may include life-threatening hypotension and death, can occur within hours.• If a hypersensitivity reaction is ruled out, patients may restart abacavir and lamivudine. Rarely, patients who have stopped abacavir for reasons other than symptoms of hypersensitivity have also experienced life-threatening reactions within hours of reinitiating abacavir therapy.Therefore, reintroduction of abacavir and lamivudine or any other abacavir-containing product is recommended only if medical care can be readily accessed.• A Medication Guide and Warning Card that provide information about recognition of hypersensitivity reactions should be dispensed with each new prescription and refill.\n5.2 Patients with Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection\nPosttreatment Exacerbations of HepatitisClinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR (lamivudine). Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment.Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBVSafety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in subjects dually infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has been reported in HIV-1-infected subjects who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR (lamivudine).\n5.3 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis\nLactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues, including abacavir and lamivudine. A majority of these cases have been in women. Female sex and obesity may be risk factors for the development of lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis in patients treated with antiretroviral nucleoside analogues. See full prescribing information for ZIAGEN (abacavir) and EPIVIR (lamivudine). Treatment with abacavir and lamivudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity, which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations.\n5.4 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome\nImmune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including abacavir and lamivudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such asMycobacterium aviuminfection, cytomegalovirus,Pneumocystis jiroveciipneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.\n5.5 Myocardial Infarction\nSeveral prospective, observational, epidemiological studies have reported an association with the use of abacavir and the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). Meta-analyses of randomized, controlled clinical trials have observed no excess risk of MI in abacavir-treated subjects as compared with control subjects. To date, there is no established biological mechanism to explain the potential increase in risk. In totality, the available data from the observational studies and from controlled clinical trials show inconsistency; therefore, evidence for a causal relationship between abacavir treatment and the risk of MI is inconclusive.\nAs a precaution, the underlying risk of coronary heart disease should be considered when prescribing antiretroviral therapies, including abacavir, and action taken to minimize all modifiable risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).\n6. Adverse Reactions/Side Effects\nThe following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling:• Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions[seeBoxed Warning,Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].• Exacerbations of hepatitis B[seeBoxed Warning,Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].• Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.3)].• Immune reconstitution syndrome[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.4)].• Myocardial infarction[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.5)].\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Subjects\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.Serious and Fatal Abacavir-Associated Hypersensitivity ReactionsIn clinical trials, serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with abacavir, a component of abacavir and lamivudine[seeBoxed Warning,Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. These reactions have been characterized by 2 or more of the following signs or symptoms: (1) fever; (2) rash; (3) gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain); (4) constitutional symptoms (including generalized malaise, fatigue, or achiness); (5) respiratory symptoms (including dyspnea, cough, or pharyngitis). Almost all abacavir hypersensitivity reactions include fever and/or rash as part of the syndrome.Other signs and symptoms have included lethargy, headache, myalgia, edema, arthralgia, and paresthesia. Anaphylaxis, liver failure, renal failure, hypotension, adult respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, myolysis, and death have occurred in association with these hypersensitivity reactions. Physical findings have included lymphadenopathy, mucous membrane lesions (conjunctivitis and mouth ulcerations), and maculopapular or urticarial rash (although some patients had other types of rashes and others did not have a rash). There were reports of erythema multiforme. Laboratory abnormalities included elevated liver chemistries, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevated creatinine, and lymphopenia and abnormal chest x-ray findings (predominantly infiltrates, which were localized).Additional Adverse Reactions with Use of abacavir and lamivudineTherapy-Naive Adults:Treatment-emergent clinical adverse reactions (rated by the investigator as moderate or severe) with greater than or equal to 5% frequency during therapy with ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily or ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily, both in combination with lamivudine 300 mg once daily and efavirenz 600 mg once daily, are listed in Table 1.\nTable 1. Treatment-Emergent (All Causality) Adverse Reactions of at Least Moderate Intensity (Grades 2 to 4, Greater than or Equal to 5% Frequency) in Therapy-Naive Adults (CNA30021) through 48 Weeks of Treatment\naSubjects receiving ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily, experienced a significantly higher incidence of severe drug hypersensitivity reactions and severe diarrhea compared with subjects who received ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily. Five percent (5%) of subjects receiving ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily had severe drug hypersensitivity reactions compared with 2% of subjects receiving ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily. Two percent (2%) of subjects receiving ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily had severe diarrhea while none of the subjects receiving ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily had this event.\nbCNA30024 was a multi-center, double-blind, controlled trial in which 649 HIV-1-infected, therapy-naive adults were randomized and received either ZIAGEN (300 mg twice daily), EPIVIR (150 mg twice daily), and efavirenz (600 mg once daily); or zidovudine (300 mg twice daily), EPIVIR (150 mg twice daily), and efavirenz (600 mg once daily). CNA30024 used double-blind ascertainment of suspected hypersensitivity reactions. During the blinded portion of the trial, suspected hypersensitivity to abacavir was reported by investigators in 9% of 324 subjects in the abacavir group and 3% of 325 subjects in the zidovudine group.Laboratory Abnormalities:Laboratory abnormalities observed in clinical trials of ZIAGEN were anemia, neutropenia, liver function test abnormalities, and elevations of CPK, blood glucose, and triglycerides. Additional laboratory abnormalities observed in clinical trials of EPIVIR were thrombocytopenia and elevated levels of bilirubin, amylase, and lipase.The frequencies of treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities were comparable between treatment groups in CNA30021.Other Adverse Events: In addition to adverse reactions listed above, other adverse events observed in the expanded access program for abacavir were pancreatitis and increased GGT.\n6.2 Clinical Trials Experience in Pediatric Subjects\nThe safety of once-daily compared with twice-daily dosing of abacavir and lamivudine, administered as either single products or as abacavir and lamivudine, was assessed in the ARROW trial (n = 336). Primary safety assessment in the ARROW (COL105677) trial was based on Grade 3 and Grade 4 adverse events. The frequency of Grade 3 and 4 adverse events was similar among subjects randomized to once-daily dosing compared with subjects randomized to twice-daily dosing. One event of Grade 4 hepatitis in the once-daily cohort was considered as uncertain causality by the investigator and all other Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were considered not related by the investigator. No additional safety issues were identified in pediatric subjects receiving abacavir and lamivudine once-daily compared with historical data in adults[seeAdverse Reactions (6.1)].\n6.3 Postmarketing Experience\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.AbacavirCardiovascular:Myocardial infarction.Skin:Suspected Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients receiving abacavir primarily in combination with medications known to be associated with SJS and TEN, respectively. Because of the overlap of clinical signs and symptoms between hypersensitivity to abacavir and SJS and TEN, and the possibility of multiple drug sensitivities in some patients, abacavir should be discontinued and not restarted in such cases. There have also been reports of erythema multiforme with abacavir use[seeAdverse Reactions (6.1)].Abacavir and LamivudineBody as a Whole:Redistribution/accumulation of body fat.Digestive:Stomatitis.Endocrine and Metabolic:Hyperglycemia.General:Weakness.Hemic and Lymphatic:Aplastic anemia, anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy), lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly.Hepatic:Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.3)], posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis B[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2)].Hypersensitivity:Sensitization reactions (including anaphylaxis), urticaria.Musculoskeletal:Muscle weakness, creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation, rhabdomyolysis.Nervous:Paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy, seizures.Respiratory:Abnormal breath sounds/wheezing.Skin:Alopecia, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.\nRelated/similar drugs\nBiktarvy\nBiktarvy is a complete HIV-1 treatment in a once-a-day single tablet containing three antiviral ...\nDescovy\nDescovy is used to treat and prevent HIV infection in adults and adolescents.

Drug Interactions\n7.1 Methadone\nIn a trial of 11 HIV-1-infected subjects receiving methadone-maintenance therapy with 600 mg of ZIAGEN twice daily (twice the currently recommended dose), oral methadone clearance increased[seeClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].This alteration will not result in a methadone dose modification in the majority of patients; however, an increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients.\n7.2 Sorbitol\nCoadministration of single doses of lamivudine and sorbitol resulted in a sorbitol dose-dependent reduction in lamivudine exposures. When possible, avoid use of sorbitol-containing medicines with lamivudine-containing medicines[seeClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n7.3 Riociguat\nCoadministration with fixed-dose abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine resulted in increased riociguat exposure, which may increase the risk of riociguat adverse reactions[seeClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].The riociguat dose may need to be reduced. See full prescribing information for ADEMPAS (riociguat).\nDoes Abacavir/lamivudine interact with my other drugs?\nEnter medications to view a detailed interaction report using ourDrug Interaction Checker.\n8. Use In Specific Populations\n8.1 Pregnancy\nPregnancy Exposure RegistryThere is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to abacavir and lamivudine during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) at 1-800-258-4263.Risk SummaryAvailable data from the APR show no difference in the overall risk of birth defects for abacavir or lamivudine compared with the background rate for birth defects of 2.7% in the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) reference population (see Data). The APR uses the MACDP as the U.S. reference population for birth defects in the general population. The MACDP evaluates women and infants from a limited geographic area and does not include outcomes for births that occurred at less than 20 weeks’ gestation. The rate of miscarriage is not reported in the APR. The estimated background rate of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies in the U.S. general population is 15% to 20%. The background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of abacavir to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in fetal malformations and other embryonic and fetal toxicities at exposures 35 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical daily dose. However, no adverse developmental effects were observed following oral administration of abacavir to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis, at exposures approximately 9 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose. Oral administration of lamivudine to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in embryolethality at systemic exposure (AUC) similar to the recommended clinical dose; however, no adverse development effects were observed with oral administration of lamivudine to pregnant rats during organogenesis at plasma concentrations (Cmax) 35 times the recommended clinical dose(see Data).DataHuman Data: Abacavir:Based on prospective reports to the APR of exposures to abacavir during pregnancy resulting in live births (including over 1,300 exposed in the first trimester and over 1,300 exposed in the second/third trimester), there was no difference between the overall risk of birth defects for abacavir compared with the background birth defect rate of 2.7% in the U.S. reference population of the MACDP. The prevalence of defects in live births was 3.2% (95% CI: 2.3% to 4.3%) following first trimester exposure to abacavir-containing regimens and 2.9% (95% CI: 2.1% to 4.0%) following second/third trimester exposure to abacavir-containing regimens.Abacavir has been shown to cross the placenta and concentrations in neonatal plasma at birth were essentially equal to those in maternal plasma at delivery[seeClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].Lamivudine:Based on prospective reports to the APR of exposures to lamivudine during pregnancy resulting in live births (including over 5,300 exposed in the first trimester and over 7,400 exposed in the second/third trimester), there was no difference between the overall risk of birth defects for lamivudine compared with the background birth defect rate of 2.7% in the U.S. reference population of the MACDP. The prevalence of birth defects in live births was 3.1% (95% CI: 2.7% to 3.6%) following first trimester exposure to lamivudine-containing regimens and 2.9% (95% CI: 2.5%, 3.3%) following second/third trimester exposure to lamivudine-containing regimens.Lamivudine pharmacokinetics were studied in pregnant women during 2 clinical trials conducted in South Africa. The trials assessed pharmacokinetics in 16 women at 36 weeks’ gestation using 150 mg lamivudine twice daily with zidovudine, 10 women at 38 weeks’ gestation using 150 mg lamivudine twice daily with zidovudine, and 10 women at 38 weeks’ gestation using lamivudine 300 mg twice daily without other antiretrovirals. These trials were not designed or powered to provide efficacy information. Lamivudine concentrations were generally similar in maternal, neonatal, and umbilical cord serum samples. In a subset of subjects, amniotic fluid specimens were collected following natural rupture of membranes and confirmed that lamivudine crosses the placenta in humans. Based on limited data at delivery, median (range) amniotic fluid concentrations of lamivudine were 3.9 (1.2 to 12.8)–fold greater compared with paired maternal serum concentration (n = 8).Animal Data: Abacavir: Abacavir was administered orally to pregnant rats (at 100, 300, and 1,000 mg per kg per day) and rabbits (at 125, 350, or 700 mg per kg per day) during organogenesis (on Gestation Days 6 through 17 and 6 through 20, respectively). Fetal malformations (increased incidences of fetal anasarca and skeletal malformations) or developmental toxicity (decreased fetal body weight and crown-rump length) were observed in rats at doses up to 1,000 mg per kg per day, resulting in exposures approximately 35 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended daily dose. No developmental effects were observed in rats at 100 mg per kg per day, resulting in exposures (AUC) 3.5 times the human exposure at the recommended daily dose. In a fertility and early embryo-fetal development study conducted in rats (at 60, 160, or 500 mg per kg per day), embryonic and fetal toxicities (increased resorptions, decreased fetal body weights) or toxicities to the offspring (increased incidence of stillbirth and lower body weights) occurred at doses up to 500 mg per kg per day. No developmental effects were observed in rats at 60 mg per kg per day, resulting in exposures (AUC) approximately 4 times the human exposure at the recommended daily dose. Studies in pregnant rats showed that abacavir is transferred to the fetus through the placenta. In pregnant rabbits, no developmental toxicities and no increases in fetal malformations occurred at up to the highest dose evaluated, resulting in exposures (AUC) approximately 9 times the human exposure at the recommended dose.Lamivudine:Lamivudine was administered orally to pregnant rats (at 90, 600, and 4,000 mg per kg per day) and rabbits (at 90, 300 and 1,000 mg per kg per day and at 15, 40, and 90 mg per kg per day) during organogenesis (on Gestation Days 7 through 16 [rat] and 8 through 20 [rabbit]). No evidence of fetal malformations due to lamivudine was observed in rats and rabbits at doses producing plasma concentrations (Cmax) approximately 35 times higher than human exposure at the recommended daily dose. Evidence of early embryolethality was seen in the rabbit at systemic exposures (AUC) similar to those observed in humans, but there was no indication of this effect in the rat at plasma concentrations (Cmax) 35 times higher than human exposure at the recommended daily dose. Studies in pregnant rats showed that lamivudine is transferred to the fetus through the placenta. In the fertility/pre-and postnatal development study in rats, lamivudine was administered orally at doses of 180, 900, and 4,000 mg per kg per day from  prior to mating  through postnatal Day 20). In the study, development of the offspring, including fertility and reproductive performance, were not affected by the maternal administration of lamivudine.\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk SummaryThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV-1-infected mothers in the United States not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV-1 infection. Abacavir and lamivudine are present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of abacavir and lamivudine on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Because of the potential for (1) HIV-1 transmission (in HIV-negative infants), (2) developing viral resistance (in HIV-positive infants), and (3) adverse reactions in a breastfed infant similar to those seen in adults, instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving abacavir and lamivudine.\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe dosing recommendations in this population are based on the safety and efficacy established in a controlled trial conducted using either the combination of EPIVIR and ZIAGEN or abacavir and lamivudine[seeDosage and Administration (2.3),Adverse Reactions (6.2),Clinical Studies (14.2)].In pediatric patients weighing less than 25 kg, use of abacavir and lamivudine as single products is recommended to achieve appropriate dosing.\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nClinical trials of abacavir and lamivudine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, caution should be exercised in the administration of abacavir and lamivudine in elderly patients reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy[seeDosage and Administration (2.4),Use in Specific Populations (8.6,8.7)].\n8.6 Patients with Impaired Renal Function\nAbacavir and lamivudine is not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL per min because abacavir and lamivudine is a fixed-dose combination and the dosage of the individual components cannot be adjusted. If a dose reduction of lamivudine, a component of abacavir and lamivudine, is required for patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL per min, then the individual components should be used[seeClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].Patients with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL per min receiving abacavir and lamivudine may experience a 1.6- to 3.3-fold higher lamivudine exposure (AUC) than patients with a creatinine clearance ≥50 mL per min. There are no safety data from randomized, controlled trials comparing abacavir and lamivudine to the individual components in patients with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL per min who received dose-adjusted lamivudine. In the original lamivudine registrational trials in combination with zidovudine, higher lamivudine exposures were associated with higher rates of hematologic toxicities (neutropenia and anemia), although discontinuations due to neutropenia or anemia each occurred in <1% of subjects. Patients with a sustained creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL per min who receive abacavir and lamivudine should be monitored for hematologic toxicities. If new or worsening neutropenia or anemia develop, dose adjustment of lamivudine, per lamivudine prescribing information, is recommended. If lamivudine dose adjustment is indicated, abacavir and lamivudine should be discontinued and the individual components should be used to construct the treatment regimen.\n8.7 Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function\nAbacavir and lamivudine is a fixed-dose combination and the dosage of the individual components cannot be adjusted. If a dose reduction of abacavir, a component of abacavir and lamivudine, is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), then the individual components should be used[seeClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir have not been established in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment; therefore, abacavir and lamivudine is contraindicated in these patients[seeContraindications (4)].\n10. Overdosage\nThere is no known specific treatment for overdose with abacavir and lamivudine. If overdose occurs, the patient should be monitored, and standard supportive treatment applied as required.Abacavir:It is not known whether abacavir can be removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis.Lamivudine:Because a negligible amount of lamivudine was removed via (4-hour) hemodialysis, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, and automated peritoneal dialysis, it is not known if continuous hemodialysis would provide clinical benefit in a lamivudine overdose event.\n11. Abacavir and Lamivudine Tablets Description\nAbacavir and Lamivudine Tablets, USPAbacavir and Lamivudine tablets, USP contain the following 2 synthetic nucleoside analogues: abacavir sulfate USP (ZIAGEN, also a component of TRIZIVIR) and lamivudine USP (also known as EPIVIR or 3TC) with inhibitory activity against HIV-1.Abacavir and Lamivudine tablets, USP are for oral administration.

Abacavir and Lamivudine Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nAbacavir and lamivudine is an antiretroviral agent with activity against HIV-1[seeMicrobiology (12.4)].\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nPharmacokinetics in AdultsIn a single-dose, 3-way crossover bioavailability trial of 1 abacavir and lamivudine tablet versus 2 ZIAGEN tablets (2 x 300 mg) and 2 EPIVIR tablets (2 x 150 mg) administered simultaneously in healthy subjects (n = 25), there was no difference in the extent of absorption, as measured by the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximal peak concentration (Cmax), of each component.Abacavir:Following oral administration, abacavir is rapidly absorbed and extensively distributed. After oral administration of a single dose of 600 mg of abacavir in 20 subjects, Cmaxwas 4.26 ± 1.19 mcg per mL (mean ± SD) and AUC∞ was 11.95 ± 2.51 mcg·hour per mL. Binding of abacavir to human plasma proteins is approximately 50% and was independent of concentration. Total blood and plasma drug-related radioactivity concentrations are identical, demonstrating that abacavir readily distributes into erythrocytes. The primary routes of elimination of abacavir are metabolism by alcohol dehydrogenase to form the 5’-carboxylic acid and glucuronyl transferase to form the 5’-glucuronide.Lamivudine:Following oral administration, lamivudine is rapidly absorbed and extensively distributed. After multiple-dose oral administration of lamivudine 300 mg once daily for 7 days to 60 healthy subjects, steady-state Cmax(Cmax,ss) was 2.04 ± 0.54 mcg per mL (mean  ± SD) and the 24-hour steady-state AUC (AUC24,ss) was 8.87 ± 1.83 mcg·hour per mL. Binding to plasma protein is low. Approximately 70% of an intravenous dose of lamivudine is recovered as unchanged drug in the urine. Metabolism of lamivudine is a minor route of elimination. In humans, the only known metabolite is the trans-sulfoxide metabolite (approximately 5% of an oral dose after 12 hours).In humans, abacavir and lamivudine are not significantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes.The pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir and lamivudine in fasting subjects are summarized in Table 2.Table 2. Pharmacokinetic Parametersafor Abacavir and Lamivudine in Adults\naData presented as mean ± standard deviation except where noted.bApproximate range.\nEffect of Food on Absorption of Abacavir and Lamivudine\nAbacavir and lamivudine may be administered with or without food. Administration with a high-fat meal in a single-dose bioavailability trial resulted in no change in AUC last, AUC∞, and Cmaxfor lamivudine. Food did not alter the extent of systemic exposure to abacavir (AUC∞), but the rate of absorption (Cmax) was decreased approximately 24% compared with fasted conditions   (n = 25). These results are similar to those from previous trials of the effect of food on abacavir and lamivudine tablets administered separately.Specific PopulationsPatients with Renal Impairment:The pharmacokinetics for the individual lamivudine component of abacavir and lamivudine has been evaluated in patients with renal impairment (see the U.S. prescribing information for the individual lamivudine component).Patients with Hepatic Impairment:The pharmacokinetics for the individual components of abacavir and lamivudine have been evaluated in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment (see the U.S. prescribing information for the individual abacavir and lamivudine components).Pregnant Women: Abacavir:Abacavir pharmacokinetics were studied in 25 pregnant women during the last trimester of pregnancy receiving abacavir 300 mg twice daily. Abacavir exposure (AUC) during pregnancy was similar to those in postpartum and in HIV-infected non-pregnant historical controls. Consistent with passive diffusion of abacavir across the placenta, abacavir concentrations in neonatal plasma cord samples at birth were essentially equal to those in maternal plasma at delivery.Lamivudine:Lamivudine pharmacokinetics were studied in 36 pregnant women during 2 clinical trials conducted in South Africa. Lamivudine pharmacokinetics in pregnant women were similar to those seen in non-pregnant adults and in postpartum women. Lamivudine concentrations were generally similar in maternal, neonatal, and umbilical cord serum samples.Pediatric Patients: Abacavir and Lamivudine:The pharmacokinetic data for abacavir and lamivudine following administration of abacavir and lamivudine in pediatric subjects weighing 25 kg and above are limited. The dosing recommendations in this population are based on the safety and efficacy established in a controlled trial conducted using either the combination of EPIVIR and ZIAGEN or abacavir and lamivudine. Refer to the EPIVIR and ZIAGEN USPI for pharmacokinetic information on the individual products in pediatric patients[seeDosage and Administration (2.3),Adverse Reactions (6.2),Clinical Studies (14.2)].Geriatric Patients:The pharmacokinetics of abacavir and lamivudine have not been studied in subjects over 65 years of age.Male and  Female Patients:There are no significant or clinically relevant gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of the individual components (abacavir or lamivudine) based on the available information that was analyzed for each of the individual components.Racial Groups:There are no significant or clinically relevant racial differences in pharmacokinetics of the individual components (abacavir or lamivudine) based on the available information that was analyzed for each of the individual components.\nDrug Interaction StudiesThe drug interactions described are based on trials conducted with abacavir or lamivudine as single entities; no drug interaction trials have been conducted with abacavir and lamivudine.Effect of Abacavir and Lamivudine on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Agents:In vitro studies have shown that abacavir has potential to inhibit CYP1A1 and limited potential to inhibit metabolism mediated by CYP3A4. Lamivudine does not inhibit or induce CYP3A4. Abacavir and lamivudine do not inhibit or induce other CYP enzymes (such as CYP2C9 or CYP2D6). Based onin vitrostudy results, abacavir and lamivudine at therapeutic drug exposures are not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are substrates of the following transporters: organic anion transporter polypeptide (OATP)1B1/3, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) or P-glycoprotein (P-gp), organic cation transporter (OCT)1, OCT2, OCT3 (lamivudine only), or multidrug and toxic extrusion protein (MATE)1 and MATE2-K.Riociguat:Coadministration of a single dose of riociguat (0.5 mg) to HIV-1–infected subjects receiving fixed-dose abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine is reported to increase riociguat AUC(∞) compared with riociguat AUC(∞) reported in healthy subjects due to CYP1A1 inhibition by abacavir. The exact magnitude of increase in riociguat exposure has not been fully characterized based on findings from two studies[seeDrug Interactions (7.3)].Effect of Other Agents on the Pharmacokinetics of Abacavir or Lamivudine:Abacavir and lamivudine are not significantly metabolized by CYP enzymes; therefore, CYP enzyme inhibitors or inducers are not expected to affect their concentrations.In vitro, abacavir is not a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, MATE1, MATE2-K, multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) or MRP4; therefore, drugs that modulate these transporters are not expected to affect abacavir plasma concentrations. Abacavir is a substrate of BCRP and P-gpin vitro; however, considering its absolute bioavailability (83%), modulators of these transporters are unlikely to result in a clinically relevant impact on abacavir concentrations.Lamivudine is a substrate of MATE1, MATE2-K, and OCT2in vitro. Trimethoprim (an inhibitor of these drug transporters) has been shown to increase lamivudine plasma concentrations. This interaction is not considered clinically significant as no dose adjustment of lamivudine is needed.Lamivudine is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP; however, considering its absolute bioavailability (87%), it is unlikely that these transporters play a significant role in the absorption of lamivudine. Therefore, coadministration of drugs that are inhibitors of these efflux transporters is unlikely to affect the disposition and elimination of lamivudine.Abacavir:Lamivudine and/or Zidovudine:Fifteen HIV-1-infected subjects were enrolled in a crossover-designed drug interaction trial evaluating single doses of abacavir (600 mg), lamivudine (150 mg), and zidovudine (300 mg) alone or in combination. Analysis showed no clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of abacavir with the addition of lamivudine or zidovudine or the combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. Lamivudine exposure (AUC decreased 15%) and zidovudine exposure (AUC increased 10%) did not show clinically relevant changes with concurrent abacavir.Lamivudine: Zidovudine:No clinically significant alterations in lamivudine or zidovudine pharmacokinetics were observed in 12 asymptomatic HIV-1-infected adult subjects given a single dose of zidovudine (200 mg) in combination with multiple doses of lamivudine (300 mg every 12 h).Other InteractionsEthanol: Abacavir has no effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of ethanol. Ethanol decreases the elimination of abacavir causing an increase in overall exposure.Interferon Alfa:There was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between lamivudine and interferon alfa in a trial of 19 healthy male subjects.Methadone:In a trial of 11 HIV-1-infected subjects receiving methadone-maintenance therapy     (40 mg and 90 mg daily), with 600 mg of ZIAGEN twice daily (twice the currently recommended dose), oral methadone clearance increased 22% (90% CI: 6% to 42%)[seeDrug Interactions (7)].The addition of methadone has no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir.Ribavirin:In vitrodata indicate ribavirin reduces phosphorylation of lamivudine, stavudine, and zidovudine. However, no pharmacokinetic (e.g., plasma concentrations or intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations) or pharmacodynamic (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) interaction was observed when ribavirin and lamivudine (n = 18), stavudine (n = 10), or zidovudine (n = 6) were coadministered as part of a multi-drug regimen to HIV-1/HCV co-infected subjects.Sorbitol (Excipient):Lamivudine and sorbitol solutions were coadministered to 16 healthy adult subjects in an open-label, randomized-sequence, 4-period, crossover trial. Each subject received a single 300-mg dose of lamivudine oral solution alone or coadministered with a single dose of  3.2 grams, 10.2 grams, or 13.4 grams of sorbitol in solution. Coadministration of lamivudine with sorbitol resulted in dose-dependent decreases of 20%, 39%, and 44% in the AUC(0 to 24); 14%, 32%, and 36% in the AUC(∞); and 28%, 52%, and 55% in the Cmax; of lamivudine, respectively.The effects of other coadministered drugs on abacavir or lamivudine are provided in Table 3.Table 3. Effect of Coadministered Drugs on Abacavir or Lamivudine\n↑ = Increase; ↔ = No significant change; AUC = Area under the concentration versus time curve; CI = Confidence interval.aThe drug-drug interaction was only evaluated in males.\n12.4 Microbiology\nMechanism of ActionAbacavir:Abacavir is a carbocyclic synthetic nucleoside analogue. Abacavir is converted by cellular enzymes to the active metabolite, carbovir triphosphate (CBV-TP), an analogue of deoxyguanosine-5’-triphosphate (dGTP). CBV-TP inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) both by competing with the natural substrate dGTP and by its incorporation into viral DNA.Lamivudine:Lamivudine is a synthetic nucleoside analogue. Intracellularly lamivudine is phosphorylated to its active 5’-triphosphate metabolite, lamivudine triphosphate (3TC-TP). The principal mode of action of 3TC-TP is inhibition of RT via DNA chain termination after incorporation of the nucleotide analogue.Antiviral Activity\n\nAbacavir:The antiviral activity of abacavir against HIV-1 was assessed in a number of cell lines including primary monocytes/macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). EC50values ranged from 3,700 to 5,800 nM (1 nM = 0.28 ng per mL) and 70 to 1,000 nM against HIV-1IIIBand HIV-1BaL, respectively, and the mean EC50value was 260 ± 180 nM against 8 clinical isolates. The median EC50values of abacavir were 344 nM (range: 14.8 to 676 nM), 16.9 nM (range: 5.9 to 27.9 nM), 8.1 nM (range: 1.5 to 16.7 nM), 356 nM (range: 35.7 to 396 nM), 105 nM (range: 28.1 to 168 nM), 47.6 nM (range: 5.2 to 200 nM), 51.4 nM (range: 7.1 to 177 nM), and 282 nM (range: 22.4 to 598 nM) against HIV-1 clades A-G and group O viruses (n = 3 except n = 2 for clade B), respectively. The EC50values against HIV-2 isolates (n = 4) ranged from 24 to 490 nM.Lamivudine:The antiviral activity of lamivudine against HIV-1 was assessed in a number of cell lines including monocytes and PBMCs using standard susceptibility assays. EC50values were in the range of 3 to 15,000 nM (1 nM = 0.23 ng per mL). The median EC50values of lamivudine were 60 nM (range: 20 to 70 nM), 35 nM (range: 30 to 40 nM), 30 nM (range: 20 to 90 nM), 20 nM (range: 3 to 40 nM), 30 nM (range: 1 to 60 nM), 30 nM (range: 20 to 70 nM), 30 nM (range: 3 to 70 nM), and 30 nM (range: 20 to 90 nM) against HIV-1 clades A-G and group O viruses (n = 3 except n = 2 for clade B), respectively. The EC50values against HIV-2 isolates (n = 4) ranged from 3 to 120 nM in PBMCs. Ribavirin (50,000 nM) used in the treatment of chronic HCV infection decreased the anti-HIV-1 activity of lamivudine by 3.5-fold in MT-4 cells.The combination of abacavir and lamivudine has demonstrated antiviral activity in cell culture against non-subtype B isolates and HIV-2 isolates with equivalent antiviral activity as for subtype B isolates. Neither abacavir, nor lamivudine, were antagonistic to all tested anti-HIV agents. See full prescribing information for ZIAGEN (abacavir) and EPIVIR (lamivudine). Ribavirin, used in the treatment of HCV infection, decreased the anti-HIV-1 potency of abacavir/lamivudine reproducibly by 2- to 6-fold in cell culture.ResistanceHIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to the combination of abacavir and lamivudine have been selected in cell culture with amino acid substitutions K65R, L74V, Y115F, and M184V/I emerging in HIV-1 RT. M184V or I substitutions resulted in high-level resistance to lamivudine and an approximately 2-fold decrease in susceptibility to abacavir. Substitutions K65R, L74M, or Y115F with M184V or I conferred a 7- to 8-fold reduction in abacavir susceptibility, and combinations of three substitutions were required to confer more than an 8-fold reduction in susceptibility.Cross-ResistanceCross-resistance has been observed among nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). The combination of abacavir/lamivudine has demonstrated decreased susceptibility to viruses with a K65R substitution with or without an M184V/I substitution, viruses with L74V plus the M184V/I substitution, and viruses with thymidine analog mutation substitutions (TAMs: M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, K219E/R/H/Q/N) plus M184V. An increasing number of TAMs is associated with a progressive reduction in abacavir susceptibility.\n13. Nonclinical Toxicology\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenicityAbacavir:Abacavir was administered orally at 3 dosage levels to separate groups of mice and rats in 2-year carcinogenicity studies. Results showed an increase in the incidence of malignant and non-malignant tumors. Malignant tumors occurred in the preputial gland of males and the clitoral gland of females of both species, and in the liver of female rats. In addition, non-malignant tumors also occurred in the liver and thyroid gland of female rats. These observations were made at systemic exposures in the range of 6 to 32 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 600 mg.Lamivudine:Long-term carcinogenicity studies with lamivudine in mice and rats showed no evidence of carcinogenic potential at exposures up to 10 times (mice) and 58 times (rats) the human exposures at the recommended dose of 300 mg.MutagenicityAbacavir:Abacavir induced chromosomal aberrations both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation in anin vitrocytogenetic study in human lymphocytes. Abacavir was mutagenic in the absence of metabolic activation, although it was not mutagenic in the presence of metabolic activation in an L5178Y mouse lymphoma assay. Abacavir was clastogenic in males and not clastogenic in females in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay. Abacavir was not mutagenic in bacterial mutagenicity assays in the presence and absence of metabolic activation.Lamivudine:Lamivudine was mutagenic in an L5178Y mouse lymphoma assay and clastogenic in a cytogenetic assay using cultured human lymphocytes. Lamivudine was not mutagenic in a microbial mutagenicity assay, in anin vitrocell transformation assay, in a rat micronucleus test, in a rat bone marrow cytogenetic assay, and in an assay for unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat liver.Impairment of FertilityAbacavir:Abacavir did not affect male or female fertility in rats at a dose associated with exposures (AUC) approximately 3.3 times (male) or 4.1 times (female) those in humans at the clinically recommended dose.Lamivudine:Lamivudine did not affect male or female fertility in rats at doses up to 4,000 mg per kg per day, associated with concentrations approximately 42 times (male) or 63 times (female) higher than the concentrations (Cmax) in humans at the dose of 300 mg.\n13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology\nMyocardial degeneration was found in mice and rats following administration of abacavir for 2 years. The systemic exposures were equivalent to 7 to 24 times the expected systemic exposure in humans at a dose of 600 mg. The clinical relevance of this finding has not been determined.\n14. Clinical Studies\n14.1 Adults\nOne abacavir and lamivudine tablet given once daily is an alternative regimen to EPIVIR tablets 300 mg once daily plus ZIAGEN tablets 2 x 300 mg once daily as a component of antiretroviral therapy.The following trial was conducted with the individual components of abacavir and lamivudine.Therapy-Naive AdultsCNA30021 was an international, multicenter, double-blind, controlled trial in which 770 HIV-1-infected, therapy-naive adults were randomized and received either ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily or ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily, both in combination with EPIVIR 300 mg once daily and efavirenz 600 mg once daily. The double-blind treatment duration was at least 48 weeks. Trial participants had a mean age of 37 years; were male (81%), white (54%), black (27%), and American Hispanic (15%). The median baseline CD4+ cell count was 262 cells per mm3(range: 21 to 918 cells per mm3) and the median baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.89 log10copies per mL (range: 2.60 to 6.99 log10copies per mL).The outcomes of randomized treatment are provided in Table 4.Table 4. Outcomes of Randomized Treatment through Week 48 (CNA30021)\naSubjects achieved and maintained confirmed HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL (less than 400 copies per mL) through Week 48   (Roche AMPLICOR Ultrasensitive HIV-1 MONITOR standard test version 1.0).bIncludes viral rebound, failure to achieve confirmed less than 50 copies per mL (less than 400 copies per mL) by Week 48, and insufficient viral load response.cIncludes consent withdrawn, lost to follow-up, protocol violations, clinical progression, and other.After 48 weeks of therapy, the median CD4+ cell count increases from baseline were 188 cells per mm3in the group receiving ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily and 200 cells per mm3in the group receiving ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily. Through Week 48, 6 subjects (2%) in the group receiving ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily (4 CDC classification C events and 2 deaths) and 10 subjects (3%) in the group receiving ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily (7 CDC classification C events and 3 deaths) experienced clinical disease progression. None of the deaths were attributed to trial medications.\n14.2 Pediatric Subjects\nARROW (COL105677) was a 5-year, randomized, multicenter trial which evaluated multiple aspects of clinical management of HIV-1 infection in pediatric subjects. HIV-1–infected, treatment-naïve subjects aged 3 months to 17 years were enrolled and treated with a first-line regimen containing abacavir and lamivudine, dosed twice daily according to World Health Organization recommendations. After a minimum of 36 weeks of treatment, subjects were given the option to participate in Randomization 3 of the ARROW trial, comparing the safety and efficacy of once-daily dosing with twice-daily dosing of abacavir and lamivudine, in combination with a third antiretroviral drug, for an additional 96 weeks. Virologic suppression was not a requirement for participation at baseline for Randomization 3. At baseline for Randomization 3 (following a minimum of 36 weeks of twice-daily treatment), 75% of subjects in the twice-daily cohort were virologically suppressed, compared with 71% of subjects in the once-daily cohort.Of the 1,206 original ARROW subjects, 669 participated in Randomization 3. Subjects randomized to receive once-daily dosing (n = 336) and who weighed at least 25 kg received abacavir 600 mg and lamivudine 300 mg, as either the single entities or as abacavir and lamivudine.The proportions of subjects with HIV-1 RNA less than 80 copies per mL through 96 weeks are shown in Table 5. The differences between virologic responses in the two treatment arms were comparable across baseline characteristics for gender and age.\nTable 5. Virologic Outcome of Randomized Treatment at Week 96a(ARROW Randomization 3)\naAnalyses were based on the last observed viral load data within the Week 96 window.bRisk difference (95% CI) of response rate is -2.4% (-9% to 5%) at Week 96.cIncludes subjects who discontinued due to lack or loss of efficacy or for reasons other than an adverse event or death, and had a viral load value of greater than or equal to 80 copies per mL, or subjects who had a switch in background regimen that was not permitted by the protocol.dOther includes reasons such as withdrew consent, loss to follow-up, etc. and the last available HIV-1 RNA less than 80 copies per mL (or missing).\n16. How is Abacavir and Lamivudine Tablets supplied\nAbacavir and Lamivudine is available as tablets.

Patient Counseling Information\nAdvise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).Hypersensitivity ReactionsInform patients:• that a Medication Guide and Warning Card summarizing the symptoms of the abacavir hypersensitivity reaction and other product information will be dispensed by the pharmacist with each new prescription and refill of abacavir and lamivudine tablets and instruct the patient to read the Medication Guide and Warning Card every time to obtain any new information that may be present about abacavir and lamivudine tablets. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.• to carry the Warning Card with them.• how to identify a hypersensitivity reaction[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1),Medication Guide].• that if they develop symptoms consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction they should call their healthcare provider right away to determine if they should stop taking abacavir and lamivudine tablets.• that a hypersensitivity reaction can worsen and lead to hospitalization or death if abacavir and lamivudine tablets are not immediately discontinued.• to not restart abacavir and lamivudine tablets or any other abacavir-containing product following a hypersensitivity reaction because more severe symptoms can occur within hours and may include life-threatening hypotension and death.• that if they have a hypersensitivity reaction, they should dispose of any unused abacavir and lamivudine tablets to avoid restarting abacavir.• that a hypersensitivity reaction is usually reversible if it is detected promptly and abacavir and lamivudine tablets are stopped right away.• that if they have interrupted abacavir and lamivudine tablets for reasons other than symptoms of hypersensitivity (for example, those who have an interruption in drug supply), a serious or fatal hypersensitivity reaction may occur with reintroduction of abacavir.• to not restart abacavir and lamivudine tablets or any other abacavir-containing product without medical consultation and only if medical care can be readily accessed by the patient or others.Patients with Hepatitis B or C Co-infectionAdvise patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV that worsening of liver disease has occurred in some cases when treatment with lamivudine was discontinued. Advise patients to discuss any changes in regimen with their physician[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2)].Lactic Acidosis/Hepatomegaly with SteatosisAdvise patients that lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis have been reported with use of nucleoside analogues and other antiretrovirals. Advise patients to stop taking abacavir and lamivudine tablets if they develop clinical symptoms suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.3)].Immune Reconstitution SyndromeAdvise patients to inform their healthcare provider immediately of any signs and symptoms of infection as inflammation from previous infection may occur soon after combination antiretroviral therapy, including when abacavir and lamivudine tablets is started[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.4)].Pregnancy RegistryAdvise patients that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to abacavir and lamivudine tablets during pregnancy[seeUse in Specific Populations (8.1)].LactationInstruct women with HIV-1 infection not to breastfeed because HIV-1 can be passed to the baby in the breast milk[seeUse in Specific Populations (8.2)].Missed DoseInstruct patients that if they miss a dose of abacavir and lamivudine tablets, to take it as soon as they remember. Advise patients not to double their next dose or take more than the prescribed dose[seeDosage and Administration (2)].Availability of Medication GuideInstruct patients to read the Medication Guide before starting abacavir and lamivudine tablets and to re-read it each time the prescription is renewed. Instruct patients to inform their physician or pharmacist if they develop any unusual symptom, or if any known symptom persists or worsens.EPIVIR, TRIZIVIR, and ZIAGEN are trademarks owned by or licensed to the ViiV Healthcare group of companies.The other brands listed are trademarks owned by or licensed to their respective owners and are not owned by or licensed to the Hetero Labs Limited.

All patients should be screened for the HLA-B*5701 allele prior to initiating therapy with abacavir or reinitiation of therapy with abacavir, unless patients have a previously documented HLA-B*5701 allele assessment. Discontinue abacavir immediately if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, regardless of HLA-B*5701 status and even when other diagnoses are possible[seeContraindications (4),Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].\nFollowing a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, NEVER restart abacavir or any other abacavir-containing product because more severe symptoms, including death can occur within hours. Similar severe reactions have also occurred rarely following the reintroduction of abacavir-containing products in patients who have no history of abacavir hypersensitivity[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1)].\n1. Indications and Usage for Abacavir Oral Solution\nAbacavir oral solution, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection.\n2. Abacavir Oral Solution Dosage and Administration\n2.1 Screening for HLA-B*5701 Allele prior to Starting Abacavir Oral Solution\nScreen for the HLA-B*5701 allele prior to initiating therapy with abacavir oral solution[seeBoxed Warning,Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].\n2.2 Recommended Dosage for Adult Patients\nThe recommended dosage of abacavir oral solution for adults is 600 mg daily, administered orally as either 300 mg twice daily or 600 mg once daily, in combination with other antiretroviral agents.\n2.3 Recommended Dosage for Pediatric Patients\nThe recommended dosage of abacavir oral solution in HIV-1-infected pediatric patients aged 3 months and older is 8 mg per kg orally twice daily or 16 mg per kg orally once daily (up to a maximum of 600 mg daily) in combination with other antiretroviral agents.\n2.4 Recommended Dosage for Patients with Hepatic Impairment\nThe recommended dose of abacavir oral solution in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) is 200 mg twice daily. To enable dose reduction, abacavir oral solution (10 mL twice daily) should be used for the treatment of these patients. The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir have not been established in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment; therefore, abacavir oral solution is contraindicated in these patients.\n3. Dosage Forms and Strengths\nAbacavir oral solution USP, each mL containing abacavir sulfate USP equivalent to 20 mg of abacavir, is a clear to opalescent, yellowish, strawberry-banana-flavored liquid.\n4. Contraindications\nAbacavir oral solution is contraindicated in patients:\nwho have the HLA-B*5701 allele[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1)].with prior hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1)].with moderate or severe hepatic impairment[seeUse in Specific Populations (8.6)].\n5. Warnings and Precautions\n5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions\nSerious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with abacavir. These hypersensitivity reactions have included multi-organ failure and anaphylaxis and typically occurred within the first 6 weeks of treatment with abacavir (median time to onset was 9 days); although abacavir hypersensitivity reactions have occurred any time during treatment[seeAdverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients who carry the HLA-B*5701 allele are at a higher risk of abacavir hypersensitivity reactions; although, patients who do not carry the HLA-B*5701 allele have developed hypersensitivity reactions. Hypersensitivity to abacavir was reported in approximately 206 (8%) of 2,670 patients in 9 clinical trials with abacavir-containing products where HLA-B*5701 screening was not performed. The incidence of suspected abacavir hypersensitivity reactions in clinical trials was 1% when subjects carrying the HLA-B*5701 allele were excluded. In any patient treated with abacavir, the clinical diagnosis of hypersensitivity reaction must remain the basis of clinical decision making.\nDue to the potential for severe, serious, and possibly fatal hypersensitivity reactions with abacavir:\nAll patients should be screened for the HLA-B*5701 allele prior to initiating therapy with abacavir or reinitiation of therapy with abacavir, unless patients have a previously documented HLA-B*5701 allele assessment.Abacavir is contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir and in HLA-B*5701-positive patients.Before starting abacavir, review medical history for prior exposure to any abacavir-containing product. NEVER restart abacavir or any other abacavir-containing product following a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, regardless of HLA-B*5701 status.To reduce the risk of a life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction, regardless of HLA-B*5701 status, discontinue abacavir immediately if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, even when other diagnoses are possible (e.g., acute onset respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis, pharyngitis, or influenza; gastroenteritis; or reactions to other medications).If a hypersensitivity reaction cannot be ruled out, do not restart abacavir or any other abacavir-containing products because more severe symptoms which may include life-threatening hypotension and death, can occur within hours.If a hypersensitivity reaction is ruled out, patients may restart abacavir. Rarely, patients who have stopped abacavir for reasons other than symptoms of hypersensitivity have also experienced life-threatening reactions within hours of reinitiating abacavir therapy. Therefore, reintroduction of abacavir or any other abacavir-containing product is recommended only if medical care can be readily accessed.A Medication Guide and Warning Card that provide information about recognition of hypersensitivity reactions should be dispensed with each new prescription and refill.\n5.2 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis\nLactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues, including abacavir. A majority of these cases have been in  women. Female sex and obesity may be risk factors for the development of lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis in patients treated with antiretroviral nucleoside analogues. Treatment with abacavir should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity, which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations.\n5.3 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome\nImmune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including abacavir. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such asMycobacterium aviuminfection, cytomegalovirus,Pneumocystis jiroveciipneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.\n5.4 Myocardial Infarction\nSeveral prospective, observational, epidemiological studies have reported an association with the use of abacavir and the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). Meta-analyses of randomized, controlled, clinical trials have observed  no excess risk of MI in abacavir-treated subjects as compared with control subjects. To date, there is no established biological mechanism to explain a potential increase in risk. In totality, the available data from the observational studies and from controlled clinical trials show inconsistency; therefore, evidence for a causal relationship between abacavir treatment and the risk of MI is inconclusive.As a precaution, the underlying risk of coronary heart disease should be considered when prescribing antiretroviral therapies, including abacavir, and action taken to minimize all modifiable risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).\n6. Adverse Reactions/Side Effects\nThe following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling:\nSerious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions[seeBoxed Warning,Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2)].Immune reconstitution syndrome[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.3)].Myocardial infarction[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.4)].\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Subjects\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.\nSerious and Fatal Abacavir-Associated Hypersensitivity Reactions\nIn clinical trials, serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with abacavir[seeBoxed Warning,Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].These reactions have been characterized by 2 or more of the following signs or symptoms: (1) fever; (2) rash; (3) gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain); (4) constitutional symptoms (including generalized malaise, fatigue, or achiness); (5) respiratory symptoms (including dyspnea, cough, or pharyngitis). Almost all abacavir hypersensitivity reactions include fever and/or rash as part of the syndrome.\nOther signs and symptoms have included lethargy, headache, myalgia, edema, arthralgia, and paresthesia. Anaphylaxis, liver failure, renal failure, hypotension, adult respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, myolysis, and death have occurred in association with these hypersensitivity reactions. Physical findings have included lymphadenopathy, mucous membrane lesions (conjunctivitis and mouth ulcerations), and maculopapular or urticarial rash (although some patients had other types of rashes and others did not have a rash). There were reports of erythema multiforme. Laboratory abnormalities included elevated liver chemistries, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevated creatinine, and lymphopenia, and abnormal chest x-ray findings (predominantly infiltrates, which were localized).\nAdditional Adverse Reactions with Use of Abacavir\nTherapy-Naive Adults:Treatment-emergent clinical adverse reactions (rated by the investigator as moderate or severe) with a greater than or equal to 5% frequency during therapy with abacavir 300 mg twice daily, lamivudine 150 mg twice daily, and efavirenz 600 mg daily compared with zidovudine 300 mg twice daily, lamivudine 150 mg twice daily, and efavirenz 600 mg daily from CNA30024 are listed in Table 2.\naThis trial used double-blind ascertainment of suspected hypersensitivity reactions. During the blinded portion of the trial, suspected hypersensitivity to abacavir was reported by investigators in 9% of 324 subjects in the abacavir group and 3% of 325 subjects in the zidovudine group.\nbTen (3%) cases of suspected drug hypersensitivity were reclassified as not being due to abacavir following unblinding.\nTreatment-emergent clinical adverse reactions (rated by the investigator as moderate or severe) with a greater than or equal to 5% frequency during therapy with abacavir 300 mg twice daily, lamivudine 150 mg twice daily, and zidovudine 300 mg twice daily compared with indinavir  800 mg 3 times daily, lamivudine 150 mg twice daily, and zidovudine 300 mg twice daily from CNA3005 are listed in Table 3.\nFive subjects receiving abacavir in CNA3005 experienced worsening of pre-existing depression compared with none in the indinavir arm. The background rates of pre-existing depression were similar in the 2 treatment arms.\nAbacavirOnce Daily versusAbacavirTwice Daily (CNA30021):Treatment-emergent clinical adverse reactions (rated by the investigator as at least moderate) with a greater than or equal to 5% frequency during therapy with abacavir 600 mg once daily or abacavir 300 mg twice daily, both in combination with lamivudine 300 mg once daily and efavirenz 600 mg once daily from CNA30021, were similar. For hypersensitivity reactions, subjects receiving abacavir once daily showed a rate of 9% in comparison with a rate of 7% for subjects receiving abacavir twice daily. However, subjects receiving abacavir 600 mg once daily experienced a significantly higher incidence of severe drug hypersensitivity reactions and severe diarrhea compared with subjects who received abacavir 300 mg twice daily. Five percent (5%) of subjects receiving abacavir 600 mg once daily had severe drug hypersensitivity reactions compared with 2% of subjects receiving abacavir 300 mg twice daily. Two percent (2%) of subjects receiving abacavir 600 mg once daily had severe diarrhea while none of the subjects receiving abacavir 300 mg twice daily had this event.\nLaboratory Abnormalities:Laboratory abnormalities (Grades 3 to 4) in therapy-naive adults during therapy with abacavir 300 mg twice daily, lamivudine 150 mg twice daily, and efavirenz 600 mg daily compared with zidovudine 300 mg twice daily, lamivudine 150 mg twice daily, and efavirenz 600 mg daily from CNA30024 are listed in Table 4.\nULN = Upper limit of normal.\nn = Number of subjects assessed.\nLaboratory abnormalities in CNA3005 are listed in Table 5.\nULN = Upper limit of normal.\nn = Number of subjects assessed.\nThe frequencies of treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities were comparable between treatment groups in CNA30021.\n6.2 Clinical Trials Experience in Pediatric Subjects\nTherapy-Experienced Pediatric Subjects (Twice-Daily Dosing)Treatment-emergent clinical adverse reactions (rated by the investigator as moderate or severe) with a greater than or equal to 5% frequency during therapy with abacavir 8 mg per kg twice daily, lamivudine 4 mg per kg twice daily, and zidovudine 180 mg per m2twice daily compared with lamivudine 4 mg per kg twice daily and zidovudine 180 mg per m2twice daily from CNA3006 are listed in Table 6.\nLaboratory Abnormalities:In CNA3006, laboratory abnormalities (anemia, neutropenia, liver function test abnormalities, and CPK elevations) were observed with similar frequencies as in a trial of therapy-naive adults (CNA30024). Mild elevations of blood glucose were more frequent in pediatric subjects receiving abacavir (CNA3006) as compared with adult subjects (CNA30024).Other Adverse EventsIn addition to adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported in Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, other adverse reactions observed in the expanded access program were pancreatitis and increased GGT.Pediatric Subjects Once-Daily versus Twice-Daily Dosing (COL105677):The safety of once-daily compared with twice-daily dosing of abacavir was assessed in the ARROW trial. Primary safety assessment in the ARROW trial was based on Grade 3 and Grade 4 adverse events. The frequency of Grade 3 and 4 adverse events was similar among subjects randomized to once-daily dosing compared with subjects randomized to twice-daily dosing. One event of Grade 4 hepatitis in the once-daily cohort was considered as uncertain causality by the investigator and all other Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were considered not related by the investigator.\n6.3 Postmarketing Experience\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of abacavir. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposures.\nBody as a Whole\nRedistribution/accumulation of body fat.\nCardiovascular\nMyocardial infarction.\nHepatic\nLactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2)].\nSkin\nSuspected Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients receiving abacavir primarily in combination with medications known to be associated with SJS and TEN, respectively. Because of the overlap of clinical signs and symptoms between hypersensitivity to abacavir and SJS and TEN, and the possibility of multiple drug sensitivities in some patients, abacavir should be discontinued and not restarted in such cases.\nThere have also been reports of erythema multiforme with abacavir use[seeAdverse Reactions  (6.1)].\nRelated/similar drugs\nBiktarvy\nBiktarvy is a complete HIV-1 treatment in a once-a-day single tablet containing three antiviral ...\nDescovy\nDescovy is used to treat and prevent HIV infection in adults and adolescents.

Drug Interactions\n7.1 Methadone\nIn a trial of 11 HIV-1-infected subjects receiving methadone-maintenance therapy with 600 mg of abacavir twice daily (twice the currently recommended dose), oral methadone clearance increased[seeClinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. This alteration will not result in a methadone dose modification in the majority of patients; however, an increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients.\n7.2 Riociguat\nCoadministration with fixed-dose abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine resulted in increased riociguat exposure, which may increase the risk of riociguat adverse reactions[seeClinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The riociguat dose may need to be reduced. See full prescribing information for ADEMPAS (riociguat).\nDoes Abacavir interact with my other drugs?\nEnter medications to view a detailed interaction report using ourDrug Interaction Checker.\n8. Use In Specific Populations\n8.1 Pregnancy\nPregnancy Exposure Registry\nThere is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to abacavir during pregnancy. Healthcare Providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) at 1-800-258-4263.\nRisk Summary\nAvailable data from the APR show no difference in the overall risk of birth defects for abacavir compared with the background rate for birth defects of 2.7% in the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) reference population(see Data).The APR uses the MACDP as the U.S. reference population for birth defects in the general population. The MACDP evaluates women and infants from a limited geographic area and does not include outcomes for births that occurred at less than 20 weeks' gestation. The rate of miscarriage is not reported in the APR. The estimated background rate of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies in the U.S. general population is 15% to 20%. The background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.\nIn animal reproduction studies, oral administration of abacavir to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in fetal malformations and other embryonic and fetal toxicities at exposures 35 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical daily dose. However, no adverse developmental effects were observed following oral administration of abacavir to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis, at exposures approximately 9 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose(see Data).\nData\nHuman Data:Based on prospective reports to the APR of exposures to abacavir during pregnancy resulting in live births (including over 1,300 exposed in the first trimester and over 1,300 exposed in second/third trimester), there was no difference between the overall risk of birth defects for abacavir compared with the background birth defect rate of 2.7% in the U.S. reference population of the MACDP. The prevalence of defects in live births was 3.2% (95% CI: 2.3% to 4.3%) following first trimester exposure to abacavir-containing regimens and 2.9% (95% CI: 2.1% to 4.0%) following second/third trimester exposure to abacavir-containing regimens.Abacavir has been shown to cross the placenta and concentrations in neonatal plasma at birth were essentially equal to those in maternal plasma at delivery[seeClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\nAnimal Data:Abacavir was administered orally to pregnant rats (at 100, 300, and 1,000 mg per kg per day) and rabbits (at 125, 350, or 700 mg per kg per day) during organogenesis (on Gestation Days 6 through 17 and 6 through 20, respectively). Fetal malformations (increased incidences of fetal anasarca and skeletal malformations) or developmental toxicity (decreased fetal body weight and crown-rump length) were observed in rats at doses up to 1,000 mg per kg per day, resulting in exposures approximately 35 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended daily dose. No developmental effects were observed in rats at 100 mg per kg per day, resulting in exposures (AUC) 3.5 times the human exposure at the recommended daily dose. In a fertility and early embryo-fetal development study conducted in rats (at 60, 160, or 500 mg per kg per day), embryonic and fetal toxicities (increased resorptions, decreased fetal body weights) or toxicities to the offspring (increased incidence of stillbirth and lower body weights) occurred at doses up to 500 mg per kg per day. No developmental effects were observed in rats at 60 mg per kg per day, resulting in exposures (AUC) approximately 4 times the human exposure at the recommended daily dose. Studies in pregnant rats showed that abacavir is transferred to the fetus through the placenta. In pregnant rabbits, no developmental toxicities and no increases in fetal malformations occurred at up to the highest dose evaluated, resulting in exposures (AUC) approximately 9 times the human exposure at the recommended dose.\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV-1-infected mothers in the United States not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV-1 infection. Abacavir is present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of abacavir on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Because of the potential for (1) HIV-1 transmission (in HIV-negative infants), (2) developing viral resistance (in HIV-positive infants), and (3) adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving abacavir.\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of abacavir have been established in pediatric patients aged 3 months and older. Use of abacavir is supported by pharmacokinetic trials and evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials of abacavir in adults and pediatric subjects[seeDosage and Administration (2.3),Adverse Reactions (6.2),Clinical Pharmacology (12.3),Clinical Studies (14.2)].\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nClinical trials of abacavir did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, caution should be exercised in the administration of abacavir in elderly patients reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.\n8.6 Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function\nA dose reduction is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A)[seeDosage and Administration (2.4)]. The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir have not been established in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment; therefore, abacavir is contraindicated in these patients[seeContraindications (4),Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n10. Overdosage\nThere is no known specific treatment for overdose with abacavir. If overdose occurs, the patient should be monitored and standard supportive treatment applied as required. It is not known whether abacavir can be removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis.\n11. Abacavir Oral Solution Description\nAbacavir sulfate is a synthetic carbocyclic nucleoside analogue with inhibitory activity against HIV-1. The chemical name of abacavir sulfate is(1S,cis)-4-[2-amino-6-(cyclopropylamino)-9H-purin-9-yl]-2-cyclopentene-1-methanol sulfate (salt) (2:1). Abacavir sulfate is the enantiomer with1S,4Rabsolute configuration on the cyclopentene ring. It has a molecular formula of (C14H18N6O)2•H2SO4and a molecular weight of 670.76 g per mol. It has the following structural formula:\nAbacavir sulfate USP is a white to off-white solid and is soluble in water.\nAbacavir oral solution USP is for oral administration. Each milliliter (1 mL) of abacavir oral solution USP contains abacavir sulfate USP equivalent to 20 mg of abacavir (i.e., 20 mg per mL) as active ingredient and the following inactive ingredients: artificial strawberry and banana flavors, citric acid anhydrous, methylparaben and propylparaben (added as preservatives), propylene glycol, saccharin sodium, sodium citrate (dihydrate), noncrystallizing sorbitol solution, and water.\nIn vivo, abacavir sulfate dissociates to its free base, abacavir. Dosages are expressed in terms of abacavir.\n12. Abacavir Oral Solution - Clinical Pharmacology\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nAbacavir is an antiretroviral agent[seeMicrobiology (12.4)].\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nPharmacokinetics in Adults\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir were independent of dose over the range of 300 to 1,200 mg per day.\nAbsorption:Following oral administration, abacavir is rapidly absorbed and extensively distributed.\nThe geometric mean absolute bioavailability of the tablet was 83%. Plasma abacavir AUC was similar following administration of the oral solution or tablets. After oral administration of 300 mg twice daily in 20 subjects, the steady-state peak serum abacavir concentration (Cmax) was 3 ± 0.89 mcg per mL (mean ± SD) and AUC(0-12 h)was 6.02 ± 1.73 mcg•hour per mL. After oral administration of a single dose of 600 mg of abacavir in 20 subjects, Cmaxwas 4.26 ± 1.19 mcg per mL (mean ± SD) and AUC∞was 11.95 ± 2.51 mcg•hour per mL.Effect of Food:Bioavailability of abacavir tablets was assessed in the fasting and fed states with no significant difference in systemic exposure (AUC∞); therefore, abacavir tablets may be administered with or without food. Systemic exposure to abacavir was comparable after administration of abacavir oral solution and abacavir tablets. Therefore, these products may be used interchangeably.Distribution:The apparent volume of distribution after IV administration of abacavir was 0.86 ± 0.15 L per kg, suggesting that abacavir distributes into extravascular space. In 3 subjects, the CSF AUC(0-6 h)to plasma abacavir AUC(0-6 h)ratio ranged from 27% to 33%.\nBinding of abacavir to human plasma proteins is approximately 50% and was independent of concentration. Total blood and plasma drug-related radioactivity concentrations are identical, demonstrating that abacavir readily distributes into erythrocytes.Elimination:In single-dose trials, the observed elimination half-life (t1/2) was 1.54 ± 0.63 hours. After intravenous administration, total clearance was 0.8 ± 0.24 L per hour per kg (mean ± SD).Metabolism:In humans, abacavir is not significantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. The primary routes of elimination of abacavir are metabolism by alcohol dehydrogenase to form the 5′-carboxylic acid and glucuronyl transferase to form the 5′-glucuronide. The metabolites do not have antiviral activity.In vitroexperiments reveal that abacavir does not  inhibit human CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP2C9 activity at clinically relevant concentrations.\nExcretion:Elimination of abacavir was quantified in a mass balance trial following administration of a 600 mg dose of14C-abacavir: 99% of the radioactivity was recovered, 1.2% was excreted in the urine as abacavir, 30% as the 5′-carboxylic acid metabolite, 36% as the 5′-glucuronide metabolite, and 15% as unidentified minor metabolites in the urine. Fecal elimination accounted for 16% of the dose.\nSpecific Populations\nPatients with RenalImpairment:The pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir have not been determined in patients with impaired renal function. Renal excretion of unchanged abacavir is a minor route of elimination in humans.\nPatients withHepatic Impairment:The pharmacokinetics of abacavir have been studied in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A). Results showed that there was a mean increase of 89% in the abacavir AUC and an increase of 58% in the half-life of abacavir after a single dose of 600 mg of abacavir. The AUCs of the metabolites were not modified by mild liver disease; however, the rates of formation and elimination of the metabolites were decreased[seeContraindications (4),Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].Pregnant Women:Abacavir pharmacokinetics were studied in 25 pregnant women during the last trimester of pregnancy receiving abacavir 300 mg twice daily. Abacavir exposure (AUC) during pregnancy was similar to those in postpartum and in HIV-infected non-pregnant historical controls. Consistent with passive diffusion of abacavir across the placenta, abacavir concentrations in neonatal plasma cord samples at birth were essentially equal to those in maternal plasma at delivery.\nPediatric Patients:The pharmacokinetics of abacavir have been studied after either single or repeat doses of abacavir in 169 pediatric subjects. Subjects receiving abacavir oral solution according to the recommended dosage regimen achieved plasma concentrations of abacavir similar to adults. Subjects receiving abacavir oral tablets achieved higher plasma concentrations of abacavir than subjects receiving oral solution.The pharmacokinetics of abacavir dosed once daily in HIV-1-infected pediatric subjects aged 3 months through 12 years was evaluated in 3 trials (PENTA 13 [n = 14], PENTA 15 [n = 18], and ARROW [n = 36]). All 3 trials were 2-period, crossover, open-label pharmacokinetic trials of twice- versus once-daily dosing of abacavir and lamivudine. For the oral solution as well as the tablet formulation, these 3 trials demonstrated that once-daily dosing provides comparable AUC0-24to twice-daily dosing of abacavir at the same total daily dose. The mean Cmaxwas approximately 1.6- to 2.3-fold higher with abacavir once-daily dosing compared with twice-daily dosing.\nGeriatric Patients:The pharmacokinetics of abacavir have not been studied in subjects older than 65 years.\nMale and Female Patients:A population pharmacokinetic analysis in HIV-1-infected male (n = 304) and female (n = 67) subjects showed no gender differences in abacavir AUC normalized for lean body weight.\nRacial Groups: There are no significant or clinically relevant racial differences between blacks and whites in abacavir pharmacokinetics.\nDrug Interaction Studies\nEffect of Abacavir on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Agents:In vitrostudies have shown that abacavir has potential to inhibit CYP1A1 and limited potential to inhibit metabolism mediated by CYP3A4. Abacavir did not inhibit or induce other CYP enzymes (such as CYP2C9, or CYP2D6).Based onin vitrostudy results, abacavir at therapeutic drug exposures is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are substrates of the following transporters: organic anion transporter polypeptide (OATP)1B1/3, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) or P-glycoprotein (P-gp), organic cation transporter (OCT)1, OCT2, or multidrug and toxic extrusion protein (MATE)1 and MATE2-K.Riociguat:Coadministration of a single dose of riociguat (0.5 mg) to HIV-1–infected subjects receiving fixed-dose abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine is reported to increase riociguat AUC(∞)compared with riociguat AUC(∞)reported in healthy subjects due to CYP1A1 inhibition by abacavir. The exact magnitude of increase in riociguat exposure has not been fully characterized based on findings from two studies[seeDrug Interactions (7.2)].Effect of Other Agents on the Pharmacokinetics of Abacavir:In vitro, abacavir is not a substrate of OATP1B1, OAP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, MATE1, MATE2-K, multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)2 or MRP4; therefore, drugs that modulate these transporters are not expected to affect abacavir plasma concentrations. Abacavir is a substrate of BCRP and P-gpin vitro; however, considering its absolute bioavailability (83%), modulators of these transporters are unlikely to result in a clinically relevant impact on abacavir concentrations.Lamivudine and/or Zidovudine:Fifteen HIV-1-infected subjects were enrolled in a crossover-designed drug interaction trial evaluating single doses of abacavir (600 mg), lamivudine (150 mg), and zidovudine   (300 mg) alone or in combination. Analysis showed no clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of abacavir with the addition of lamivudine or zidovudine or the combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. Lamivudine exposure (AUC decreased 15%) and zidovudine exposure (AUC increased 10%) did not show clinically relevant changes with concurrent abacavir.\nEthanol:Abacavir has no effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of ethanol. Ethanol decreases the elimination of abacavir causing an increase in overall exposure. Due to the common metabolic pathways of abacavir and ethanol via alcohol dehydrogenase, the pharmacokinetic interaction between abacavir and ethanol was studied in 24 HIV-1-infected male subjects. Each subject received the following treatments on separate occasions: a single 600 mg dose of abacavir, 0.7 g per kg ethanol (equivalent to 5 alcoholic drinks), and abacavir 600 mg plus 0.7 g per kg ethanol. Coadministration of ethanol and abacavir resulted in a 41% increase in abacavir AUC∞and a 26% increase in abacavir t1/2. Abacavir had no effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of ethanol, so no clinically significant interaction is expected in men. This interaction has not been studied in females.\nMethadone:In a trial of 11 HIV-1-infected subjects receiving methadone-maintenance therapy (40 mg and 90 mg daily), with 600 mg of abacavir twice daily (twice the currently recommended dose), oral methadone clearance increased 22% (90% CI: 6% to 42%). This alteration will not result in a methadone dose modification in the majority of patients; however, an increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients[seeDrug Interactions (7)]. The addition of methadone had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir.\n12.4 Microbiology\nAbacavir is a carbocyclic synthetic nucleoside analogue. Abacavir is converted by cellular enzymes to the active metabolite, carbovir triphosphate (CBV-TP), an analogue of deoxyguanosine-5′-triphosphate (dGTP). CBV-TP inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) both by competing with the natural substrate dGTP and by its incorporation into viral DNA.\nAntiviral Activity\nThe antiviral activity of abacavir against HIV-1 was assessed in a number of cell lines including primary monocytes/macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). EC50values ranged from 3.7 to 5.8 microM (1 microM = 0.28 mcg per mL) and 0.07 to 1 microM against HIV-1IIIBand HIV-1BaL, respectively, and the mean EC50value was 0.26 ± 0.18 microM against 8 clinical isolates. The median EC50values of abacavir were 344 nM (range: 14.8 to 676 nM), 16.9 nM (range: 5.9 to 27.9 nM), 8.1 nM (range: 1.5 to 16.7 nM), 356 nM (range: 35.7 to 396 nM), 105 nM (range: 28.1 to 168 nM), 47.6 nM (range: 5.2 to 200 nM), 51.4 nM (range: 7.1 to 177 nM), and 282 nM (range: 22.4 to 598 nM) against HIV-1 clades A-G and group O viruses (n = 3 except n = 2 for clade B), respectively. The EC50values against HIV-2 isolates (n = 4), ranged from 0.024 to 0.49 microM. The antiviral activity of abacavir in cell culture was not antagonized when combined with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, zalcitabine or zidovudine, the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) nevirapine, or the protease inhibitor (PI) amprenavir. Ribavirin (50 microM) used in the treatment of chronic HCV infection had no effect on the anti-HIV-1 activity of abacavir in cell culture.\nResistance\nHIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to abacavir have been selected in cell culture. Genotypic analysis of isolates selected in cell culture and recovered from abacavir-treated subjects demonstrated that amino acid substitutions K65R, L74V, Y115F, and M184V/I  emerged in HIV-1 RT. M184V or I substitutions resulted in an approximately 2-fold decrease in susceptibility to abacavir. Substitutions K65R, L74M, or Y115F with M184V or I conferred a 7- to 8-fold reduction in abacavir susceptibility, and combinations of three substitutions were required to confer more than an 8-fold reduction in susceptibility.\nThirty-nine percent (7 of 18) of the isolates from subjects who experienced virologic failure in the abacavir once-daily arm had a greater than 2.5-fold mean decrease in abacavir susceptibility with a median-fold decrease of 1.3 (range: 0.5 to 11) compared with 29% (5 of 17) of the failure isolates in the twice-daily arm with a median-fold decrease of 0.92 (range: 0.7 to 13).\nCross-Resistance\nCross-resistance has been observed among NRTIs. Isolates containing abacavir resistance-associated substitutions, namely, K65R, L74V, Y115F, and M184V, exhibited cross-resistance to didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, and tenofovir in cell culture and in subjects. An increasing number of thymidine analogue mutation substitutions (TAMs: M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, K219E/R/H/Q/N) is associated with a progressive reduction in abacavir susceptibility.\n13. Nonclinical Toxicology\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenicity\nAbacavir was administered orally at 3 dosage levels to separate groups of mice and rats in 2-year carcinogenicity studies. Results showed an increase in the incidence of malignant and non-malignant tumors. Malignant tumors occurred in the preputial gland of males and the clitoral gland of females of both species, and in the liver of female rats. In addition, non-malignant tumors also occurred in the liver and thyroid gland of female rats. These observations were made at systemic exposures in the range of 6 to 32 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 600 mg.\nMutagenicity\nAbacavir induced chromosomal aberrations both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation in anin vitrocytogenetic study in human lymphocytes. Abacavir was mutagenic in the absence of metabolic activation, although it was not mutagenic in the presence of metabolic activation in an L5178Y mouse lymphoma assay. Abacavir was clastogenic in males and not clastogenic in females in anin vivomouse bone marrow micronucleus assay.\nAbacavir was not mutagenic in bacterial mutagenicity assays in the presence and absence of metabolic activation.\nImpairment of Fertility\nAbacavir did not affect male or female fertility in rats at a dose associated with exposures (AUC) approximately 3.3 times (male) or 4.1 times (female) those in humans at the clinically recommended dose.\n13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology\nMyocardial degeneration was found in mice and rats following administration of abacavir for 2 years. The systemic exposures were equivalent to 7 to 24 times the expected systemic exposure in humans at a dose of 600 mg. The clinical relevance of this finding has not been determined.\n14. Clinical Studies\n14.1 Adult Trials\nTherapy-Naive Adults\nCNA30024 was a multicenter, double-blind, controlled trial in which 649 HIV-1-infected, therapy-naive adults were randomized and received either abacavir (300 mg twice daily), lamivudine (150 mg twice daily), and efavirenz (600 mg once daily); or zidovudine (300 mg twice daily), lamivudine (150 mg twice daily), and efavirenz (600 mg once daily). The duration of double-blind treatment was at least 48 weeks. Trial participants were male (81%), white (51%), black (21%), and Hispanic (26%). The median age was 35 years; the median pretreatment CD4+ cell count was 264 cells per mm3, and median plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.79 log10copies per mL. The outcomes of randomized treatment are provided in Table 7.\nTable 7. Outcomes of Randomized Treatment through Week 48 (CNA30024)\naSubjects achieved and maintained confirmed HIV-1 RNA less than or equal to 50 copies per mL (less than 400 copies per mL) through Week 48 (Roche AMPLICOR Ultrasensitive HIV-1 MONITOR standard test 1 PCR).\nbIncludes viral rebound, insufficient viral response according to the investigator, and failure to achieve confirmed less than or equal to 50 copies per mL by Week 48.\ncIncludes consent withdrawn, lost to follow up, protocol violations, those with missing data, clinical progression, and other.\nAfter 48 weeks of therapy, the median CD4+ cell count increases from baseline were 209 cells per mm3in the group receiving abacavir and 155 cells per mm3in the zidovudine group. Through Week 48, 8 subjects (2%) in the group receiving abacavir (5 CDC classification C events and 3 deaths) and 5 subjects (2%) on the zidovudine arm (3 CDC classification C events and 2 deaths) experienced clinical disease progression.\nCNA3005 was a multicenter, double-blind, controlled trial in which 562 HIV-1-infected, therapy-naive adults were randomized to receive either abacavir (300 mg twice daily) plus COMBIVIR (lamivudine 150 mg/zidovudine 300 mg twice daily), or indinavir (800 mg 3 times a day) plus COMBIVIR twice daily. The trial was stratified at randomization by pre-entry plasma HIV-1 RNA 10,000 to 100,000 copies per mL and plasma HIV-1 RNA greater than 100,000 copies per mL. Trial participants were male (87%), white (73%), black (15%), and Hispanic (9%). At baseline the median age was 36 years; the median baseline CD4+ cell count was 360 cells per mm3, and median baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.8 log10copies per mL. Proportions of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 400 copies per mL (using Roche AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR Test) through 48 weeks of treatment are summarized in Table 8.\nTable 8. Outcomes of Randomized Treatment through Week 48 (CNA3005)\naSubjects achieved and maintained confirmed HIV-1 RNA less than 400 copies per mL.\nbIncludes viral rebound and failure to achieve confirmed less than 400 copies per mL by Week 48.\ncIncludes consent withdrawn, lost to follow up, protocol violations, those with missing data, clinical progression, and other.\nTreatment response by plasma HIV-1 RNA strata is shown in Table 9.\nTable 9. Proportions of Responders through Week 48 by Screening Plasma HIV-1 RNA Levels (CNA3005)\nIn subjects with baseline viral load greater than 100,000 copies per mL, percentages of subjects with HIV-1 RNA levels less than 50 copies per mL were 31% in the group receiving abacavir versus 45% in the group receiving indinavir.\nThrough Week 48, an overall mean increase in CD4+ cell count of about 150 cells per mm3was observed in both treatment arms. Through Week 48, 9 subjects (3.4%) in the group receiving abacavir (6 CDC classification C events and 3 deaths) and 3 subjects (1.5%) in the group receiving indinavir (2 CDC classification C events and 1 death) experienced clinical disease progression.\nCNA30021 was an international, multicenter, double-blind, controlled trial in which 770 HIV-1-infected, therapy-naive adults were randomized and received either abacavir 600 mg once daily or abacavir 300 mg twice daily, both in combination with lamivudine 300 mg once daily and efavirenz 600 mg once daily. The double-blind treatment duration was at least 48 weeks. Trial participants had a mean age of 37 years; were male (81%), white (54%), black (27%), and American Hispanic (15%). The median baseline CD4+ cell count was 262 cells per mm3(range: 21 to 918 cells per mm3) and the median baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.89 log10copies per mL (range: 2.6 to 6.99 log10copies per mL).\nThe outcomes of randomized treatment are provided in Table 10.\nTable 10. Outcomes of Randomized Treatment through Week 48 (CNA30021)\naSubjects achieved and maintained confirmed HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL (less than 400 copies per mL) through Week 48 (Roche AMPLICOR Ultrasensitive HIV-1 MONITOR standard test version 1).\nbIncludes viral rebound, failure to achieve confirmed less than 50 copies per mL (less than 400 copies per mL) by Week 48, and insufficient viral load response.\ncIncludes consent withdrawn, lost to follow up, protocol violations, clinical progression, and other.\nAfter 48 weeks of therapy, the median CD4+ cell count increases from baseline were 188 cells per mm3in the group receiving abacavir 600 mg once daily and 200 cells per mm3in the group receiving abacavir 300 mg twice daily. Through Week 48, 6 subjects (2%) in the group receiving abacavir 600 mg once daily (4 CDC classification C events and 2 deaths) and 10 subjects (3%) in the group receiving abacavir 300 mg twice daily (7 CDC classification C events and 3 deaths) experienced clinical disease progression. None of the deaths were attributed to trial medications.\n14.2 Pediatric Trials\nTherapy-Experienced Pediatric Subjects\nCNA3006 was a randomized, double-blind trial comparing abacavir 8 mg per kg twice daily plus lamivudine 4 mg per kg twice daily plus zidovudine 180 mg per m2twice daily versus lamivudine 4 mg per kg twice daily plus zidovudine 180 mg per m2twice daily. Two hundred and five therapy-experienced pediatric subjects were enrolled: female (56%), white (17%), black (50%), Hispanic (30%), median age of 5.4 years, baseline CD4+ cell percent greater than 15% (median = 27%), and median baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA of 4.6 log10copies per mL. Eighty percent and 55% of subjects had prior therapy with zidovudine and lamivudine, respectively, most often in combination. The median duration of prior nucleoside analogue therapy was 2 years. At 16 weeks, the proportion of subjects responding based on plasma HIV-1 RNA less than or equal to 400 copies per mL was significantly higher in subjects receiving abacavir plus lamivudine plus zidovudine compared with subjects receiving lamivudine plus zidovudine, 13% versus 2%, respectively. Median plasma HIV-1 RNA changes from baseline were -0.53 log10copies per mL in the group receiving abacavir plus lamivudine plus zidovudine compared with -0.21 log10copies per mL in the group receiving lamivudine plus zidovudine. Median CD4+ cell count increases from baseline were 69 cells per mm3in the group receiving abacavir plus lamivudine plus zidovudine and 9 cells per mm3in the group receiving lamivudine plus zidovudine.\nOnce-Daily Dosing\nARROW (COL105677) was a 5-year randomized, multicenter trial which evaluated multiple aspects of clinical management of HIV-1 infection in pediatric subjects. HIV-1–infected, treatment-naive subjects aged 3 months to 17 years were enrolled and treated with a first-line regimen containing abacavir and lamivudine, dosed twice daily according to World Health  Organization recommendations. After a minimum of 36 weeks of treatment, subjects were given the option to participate in Randomization 3 of the ARROW trial, comparing the safety and efficacy of once-daily dosing with twice-daily dosing of abacavir and lamivudine, in  combination with a third antiretroviral drug, for an additional 96 weeks. Of the 1,206 original ARROW subjects, 669 participated in Randomization 3. Virologic suppression was not a requirement for participation at baseline for Randomization 3 (following a minimum of 36 weeks of twice-daily treatment), 75% of subjects in the twice-daily cohort were virologically suppressed compared with 71% of subjects in the once-daily cohort.\nThe proportions of subjects with HIV-1 RNA less than 80 copies per mL through 96 weeks are shown in Table 11. The differences between virologic responses in the two treatment arms were comparable across baseline characteristics for gender and age.\n16.

HIV nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI).\nUses for Abacavir Sulfate\nTreatment of HIV Infection\nUsed in conjunction with other antiretroviral agents for treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults, adolescents, and pediatric patients ≥3 months of age.\nAlso used in conjunction with other antiretroviral agents for treatment of HIV infection in full-term infants from birth†[off-label].\nCommercially available as a single entity preparation and in various fixed-combination preparations containing additional antiretroviral agents.\nCommonly used as part of a dual-NRTI “backbone” of a fully suppressive antiretroviral regimen; consult guidelines for the most current information on recommended regimens.Selection of an initial antiretroviral regimen should be individualized based on factors such as virologic efficacy, toxicity, pill burden, dosing frequency, drug-drug interaction potential, resistance test results, comorbid conditions, access, and cost.\nDonotuse abacavir or fixed combinations containing abacavir in HLA-B*5701-positive individuals.\nPostexposure Prophylaxis following Occupational Exposure to HIV (PEP)\nPostexposure prophylaxis of HIV infection following occupational exposure†[off-label](PEP) in health-care personnel and others exposed via percutaneous injury (e.g., needlestick, cut with sharp object) or mucous membrane or nonintact skin (e.g., chapped, abraded, dermatitis) contact with blood, tissue, or other body fluids that might contain HIV.\nRecommended as an alternative agent for PEP only in consultation with an HIV expert in patients who are negative for HLA-B*5701.Notrecommended for use as PEP following nonoccupational exposure to HIV due to time required for HLA-B*5701 testing.\nAbacavir Sulfate Dosage and Administration\nGeneral\nScreen all patients for HLA-B*5701 allele before abacavir or a fixed-combination preparation containing abacavir is initiated or reinitiated, unless there is documentation of previous HLA-B*5701 allele assessment.Contraindicated in HLA-B*5701-positive individuals.\nScreen all patients for HLA-B*5701 allele before abacavir or a fixed-combination preparation containing abacavir is initiated or reinitiated, unless there is documentation of previous HLA-B*5701 allele assessment.Contraindicated in HLA-B*5701-positive individuals.\nThe Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) list of error-prone abbreviations, symbols, and dose designations states that the use of abbreviations for antiretroviral medications (e.g., DOR, TAF, TDF) during the medication use process should be avoided as their use has been associated with serious medication errors.\nThe Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) list of error-prone abbreviations, symbols, and dose designations states that the use of abbreviations for antiretroviral medications (e.g., DOR, TAF, TDF) during the medication use process should be avoided as their use has been associated with serious medication errors.\nAdministration\nAdminister orally once or twice daily without regard to meals.\nIf a dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible.Do not double the next dose or take more than the prescribed dose.\nUse oral solution in pediatric patients or when solid oral dosage form is inappropriate.Use scored 300-mg tablets in adults, adolescents, and children weighing ≥14 kg who can reliably swallow tablets.\nCommercially available as a single entity preparation and in the following fixed-combination tablets for oral use: abacavir and lamivudine (Epzicom); abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine (Trizivir); and abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine (Triumeqand Triumeq PD).Exercise care to ensure that therapy is not duplicated if a fixed combination is used in conjunction with other antiretrovirals.\nDosage\nAvailable as abacavir sulfate; dosage expressed in terms of abacavir.\nAbacavir oral solution in children and adolescents ≥3 months of age: 8 mg/kg (up to 300 mg) twice daily or 16 mg/kg (up to 600 mg) once daily.\nAbacavir tablets in children weighing ≥14 kg able to swallow tablets: See Table 1 and Table 2.\nWeight (kg)\nAM dose\nPM dose\n14 to <20\n150 mg (half tablet)\n150 mg (half tablet)\n20 to <25\n150 mg (half tablet)\n300 mg\n≥25\n300 mg\n300 mg\nWeight (kg)\nOnce-daily dose\n14 to <20\n300 mg\n≥20 to <25\n450 mg (one and one-half tablets)\n≥25\n600 mg (2 tablets)\n300 mg twice daily or 600 mg once daily.\n600 mg once daily.Use in conjunction with other antiretrovirals.\nInitiate PEP as soon as possible following occupational exposure to HIV (preferably within hours); continue for 4 weeks, if tolerated.\nSpecial Populations\nIn adults with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A): 200 mg twice daily (i.e., 10 mL of oral solution twice daily).Contraindicated in those with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.\nNo specific dosage recommendations for patients with impaired renal function.\nNo specific dosage recommendations for geriatric patients.Select dosage with caution because of age-related decreases in hepatic, renal, and/or cardiac function and concomitant disease and drug therapy.\nCautions for Abacavir Sulfate\nContraindications\nPresence of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*5701 allele.Moderate or severe hepatic impairment.History of hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir.\nPresence of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*5701 allele.\nModerate or severe hepatic impairment.\nHistory of hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir.\nWarnings/Precautions\nSerious, sometimes fatal, hypersensitivity reactions reported with abacavir or fixed combinations containing abacavir (abacavir/lamivudine, abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine, abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine).(See Boxed Warning.) Patients carrying the HLA-B*5701 allele are at higher risk for abacavir hypersensitivity, although hypersensitivity reactions also reported in those who do not carry the allele.Abacavir and abacavir-containing preparations contraindicated in patients positive for HLA-B*5701 allele and in those with history of prior hypersensitivity reactions to abacavir.\nHypersensitivity manifestations usually involve signs or symptoms from ≥2 of the following: fever, rash, GI (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain), constitutional (e.g., generalized malaise, fatigue, achiness), and respiratory (e.g., pharyngitis, dyspnea, cough).Lethargy, myalgia, chills, myolysis, headache, arthralgia, edema, tachycardia, abnormal chest radiographs (predominantly infiltrates, which may be localized), paresthesia, lymphadenopathy, and mucous membrane lesions (e.g., conjunctivitis, mouth ulceration) also may occur.Usually apparent within first 6 weeks of abacavir therapy (median time to onset is 9 days), but may occur at any time.\nScreen all patients for HLA-B*5701 allele prior to initiating or reinitiating abacavir or fixed combinations containing abacavir.\nImmediately discontinue abacavir or abacavir-containing preparations as soon as a hypersensitivity reaction is first suspected.Monitor clinical status, including liver function tests, and initiate appropriate therapy.Never reinitiate abacavir or abacavir-containing preparations following a hypersensitivity reaction, regardless of HLA-B*5701 allele status and even when other diagnoses are possible.Severe or fatal hypersensitivity reactions can occur within hours after reintroduction of the drug in patients with no identified history of abacavir hypersensitivity or with unrecognized manifestations of hypersensitivity to the drug.\nStevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis reported during postmarketing experience in patients receiving abacavir concomitantly with other drugs known to be associated with these severe adverse effects.In such cases, discontinue abacavir and do not reinitiate the drug because the patient may have multiple drug sensitivities.Manifestations of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis are similar to those of abacavir hypersensitivity.Erythema multiforme also reported with abacavir.\nLactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis (sometimes fatal) reported in patients receiving HIV NRTIs (including abacavir) alone or in conjunction with other antiretrovirals.Female sex and obesity may be risk factors for development of lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis.\nSuspend treatment if there are clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (e.g., hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of markedly increased serum aminotransferase concentrations).\nMI reported in some patients receiving abacavir.\nBased on totality of data, evidence to support a causal relationship to abacavir inconclusive.To date, there is no established biological mechanism to explain a potential increase in risk of MI.\nConsider patient’s underlying risk of CHD and minimize any modifiable risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).\nDuring initial treatment, patients who respond to antiretroviral therapy may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (e.g.,Mycobacterium avium complex[MAC],M. tuberculosis, cytomegalovirus [CMV],Pneumocystis jirovecii[formerlyP. carinii]); this may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.\nAutoimmune disorders (e.g., Graves' disease, polymyositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome) also reported in the setting of immune reconstitution; time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of antiretroviral therapy.\nAntiretroviral Pregnancy Registry at 800-258-4263.\nData from the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry show no difference in the risk of overall major birth defects for abacavir compared with background rate for major birth defects.\nAbacavir crosses placenta and is distributed into cord blood.Concentrations in neonatal plasma at birth essentially equal to those in maternal plasma at delivery.In animal reproductive studies, developmental toxicities and fetal malformations reported at exposures 35 times usual human exposure.No developmental effects observed at exposures 3.5 times usual human exposure.\nDistributed into human milk.Effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production not known.\nThe HHS perinatal HIV transmission guideline provides updated recommendations on infant feeding.The guideline states that patients with HIV should receive evidence-based, patient-centered counseling to support shared decision making about infant feeding.During counseling, patients should be informed that feeding with appropriate formula or pasteurized donor human milk from a milk bank eliminates the risk of postnatal HIV transmission to the infant.Additionally, achieving and maintaining viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy and postpartum reduces the risk of breastfeeding HIV transmission to <1%, but does not completely eliminate the risk.Replacement feeding with formula or banked pasteurized donor milk is recommended when patients with HIV are not on antiretroviral therapy and/or do not have a suppressed viral load during pregnancy (at a minimum throughout the third trimester), as well as at delivery.\nNo evidence of adverse effects on fertility in animal studies.\nSafety and efficacy not established in neonates and infants <3 months of age.Adverse effects in children similar to those reported in adults (e.g., hypersensitivity reactions, GI effects).\nInsufficient experience in those ≥65 years of age to determine whether they respond differently than younger adults.Select dosage with caution because of age-related decreases in hepatic, renal, and/or cardiac function and concomitant disease and drug therapy.\nDosage adjustment necessary in adults with mild hepatic impairment.Contraindicated in those with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.\nPharmacokinetics not fully determined in patients with impaired renal function; renal excretion of unchanged abacavir only a minor route of elimination.\nCommon Adverse Effects\nAdverse effects of at least moderate intensity (≥10%) in adults: nausea, headache, fatigue and malaise, nausea and vomiting, dreams/sleep disorders.\nAdverse effects of at least moderate intensity (≥5%) in pediatric patients: fever and/or chills, nausea and vomiting, skin rash, ear, nose, and throat infections.\nDoes Abacavir interact with my other drugs?\nEnter medications to view a detailed interaction report using ourDrug Interaction Checker.\nDrug Interactions\nPotential to inhibit CYP1A1 and CYP3A4.Does not induce nor inhibit CYP2C9 or CYP2D6.Not expected to affect substrates of organic anion transporter polypeptide (OATP)1B1 or OATP1B3, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), P-glycoprotein (P-gp), organic cation transporter (OCT)1, OCT2, or multidrug and toxic extrusion protein (MATE)1 and MATE2-K.\nSubstrate of BCRP and P-gp;

plasma concentrations attained with abacavir oral tablets are higher than those observed in pediatric patients receiving the oral solution.\nHIV-1-infected pediatric patients 3 months to 12 years of age: AUC of abacavir reported with once-daily regimen of oral solution or tablets is comparable to AUC of abacavir reported with twice-daily regimen of oral solution or tablets.Mean peak plasma concentrations 1.6- to 2.3-fold higher when abacavir is administered once daily compared with administration twice daily.\nMild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A): AUC of abacavir is 89% higher than in those with normal hepatic function.\nDistribution\nAbacavir is extensively distributed following oral administration.\nDistributed into CSF.\nCrosses human placenta.Concentrations in cord blood at time of delivery generally similar to maternal serum concentrations.\nDistributed into human milk.\n50% bound to plasma proteins; binding independent of drug concentrations.\nElimination\nAbacavir is metabolized in the liver by alcohol dehydrogenase and glucuronyltransferase to inactive metabolites.\nIntracellularly, abacavir is phosphorylated and then converted to the active carbovir triphosphate by cellular kinases.Intracellular (host cell) conversion to carbovir triphosphate is necessary for the antiviral activity of the drug.\n82.2% of abacavir oral dose excreted in urine; 16% excreted in feces.\nAbout 1.5 hours.\nHalf-life of abacavir increased 58% in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A).\nStability\nStorage\n20–25°C.May be refrigerated; do not freeze.\n20–25°C.\nActions and Spectrum\nAbacavir is a carbocyclic NRTI.Pharmacologically related to, but structurally different from, other NRTIs (e.g., didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, zidovudine); also differs pharmacologically and structurally from other currently available antiretrovirals.A prodrug that is inactive until converted intracellularly to carbovir triphosphate.Active in vitro against HIV-1 and HIV-2.Has some in vitro activity against HBV and cytomegalovirus (CMV), but is inactive against other human viruses tested, including herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus, and influenza virus type A.Inhibits replication of HIV by interfering with viral RNA-directed DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase).HIV-1 with reduced susceptibility to abacavir have been produced in vitroand has emerged during therapy with the drug.Abacavir-resistant HIV may be cross-resistant to some other NRTIs (e.g., didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, tenofovir).HIV isolates highly resistant to multiple NRTIs also have reduced susceptibility to abacavir.\nAbacavir is a carbocyclic NRTI.\nPharmacologically related to, but structurally different from, other NRTIs (e.g., didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, zidovudine);

All patients should be screened for the HLA-B*5701 allele prior to initiating therapy with abacavir or reinitiation of therapy with abacavir, unless patients have a previously documented HLA-B*5701 allele assessment. Discontinue abacavir immediately if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, regardless of HLA-B*5701 status and even when other diagnoses are possible[seeContraindications (4),Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].Following a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, NEVER restart abacavir or any other abacavir-containing product because more severe symptoms, including death can occur within hours. Similar severe reactions have also occurred rarely following the reintroduction of abacavir-containing products in patients who have no history of abacavir hypersensitivity[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1)].\n1. Indications and Usage for Abacavir Sulfate Tablets\nAbacavir tablets, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, are indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection.\n2. Abacavir Sulfate Tablets Dosage and Administration\n2.1 Screening for HLA-B*5701 Allele prior to Starting Abacavir Tablets\nScreen for the HLA-B*5701 allele prior to initiating therapy with abacavir tablets[seeBoxed Warning,Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].\n2.2 Recommended Dosage for Adult Patients\nThe recommended dosage of abacavir tablets for adults is 600 mg daily, administered orally as either 300 mg twice daily or 600 mg once daily, in combination with other antiretroviral agents.\n2.3 Recommended Dosage for Pediatric Patients\nAbacavir tablets are available as scored tablet for HIV-1-infected pediatric patients weighing greater than or equal to 14 kg for whom a solid dosage form is appropriate. Before prescribing abacavir tablets, children should be assessed for the ability to swallow tablets. If a child is unable to reliably swallow abacavir tablets, the oral solution formulation should be prescribed. The recommended oral dosage of abacavir tablets for HIV-1-infected pediatric patients is presented in Table 1.\nWeight(kg)\nOnce-DailyDosing Regimena\nTwice-Daily Dosing Regimen\nAM Dose\nPM Dose\nTotalDaily Dose\n14 to <20\n1 tablet(300 mg)\n½ tablet(150 mg)\n½ tablet(150 mg)\n300 mg\n>20 to <25\n1½ tablets(450 mg)\n½ tablet(150 mg)\n1 tablet(300 mg)\n450 mg\n≥25\n2 tablets(600 mg)\n1 tablet(300 mg)\n1 tablet(300 mg)\n600 mg\naData regarding the efficacy of once-daily dosing is limited to subjects who transitioned from twice-daily dosing to once-daily dosing after 36 weeks of treatment[seeClinical Studies (14.2)].\n2.4 Recommended Dosage for Patients with Hepatic Impairment\nThe recommended dose of abacavir tablets in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) is 200 mg twice daily. To enable dose reduction, abacavir oral solution (10 mL twice daily) should be used for the treatment of these patients. The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir have not been established in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment; therefore, abacavir tablets are contraindicated in these patients.\n3. Dosage Forms and Strengths\nAbacavir tablets, containing abacavir sulfate equivalent to 300 mg abacavir, are yellow colored, biconvex, capsule shaped, coated tablet, debossed with ‘D’ and ‘88’ on either side of the score line on one side and plain with a score line on other side.\n4. Contraindications\nAbacavir tablets are contraindicated in patients:\n5. Warnings and Precautions\n5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions\nSerious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with abacavir. These hypersensitivity reactions have included multi-organ failure and anaphylaxis and typically occurred within the first 6 weeks of treatment with abacavir (median time to onset was 9 days); although abacavir hypersensitivity reactions have occurred any time during treatment[seeAdverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients who carry the HLA-B*5701 allele are at a higher risk of abacavir hypersensitivity reactions; although, patients who do not carry the HLA-B*5701 allele have developed hypersensitivity reactions. Hypersensitivity to abacavir was reported in approximately 206 (8%) of 2,670 patients in 9 clinical trials with abacavir-containing products where HLA-B*5701 screening was not performed. The incidence of suspected abacavir hypersensitivity reactions in clinical trials was 1% when subjects carrying the HLA-B*5701 allele were excluded. In any patient treated with abacavir, the clinical diagnosis of hypersensitivity reaction must remain the basis of clinical decision making.Due to the potential for severe, serious, and possibly fatal hypersensitivity reactions with abacavir:\n5.2 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis\nLactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues, including abacavir. A majority of these cases have been in women. Female sex and obesity may be risk factors for the development of lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis in patients treated with antiretroviral nucleoside analogues. Treatment with abacavir should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity, which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations.\n5.3 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome\nImmune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including abacavir. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such asMycobacterium aviuminfection, cytomegalovirus,Pneumocystis jiroveciipneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.\n5.4 Myocardial Infarction\nSeveral prospective, observational, epidemiological studies have reported an association with the use of abacavir and the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). Meta-analyses of randomized, controlled, clinical trials have observed no excess risk of MI in abacavir-treated subjects as compared with control subjects. To date, there is no established biological mechanism to explain a potential increase in risk. In totality, the available data from the observational studies and from controlled clinical trials show inconsistency; therefore, evidence for a causal relationship between abacavir treatment and the risk of MI is inconclusive.\nAs a precaution, the underlying risk of coronary heart disease should be considered when prescribing antiretroviral therapies, including abacavir, and action taken to minimize all modifiable risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).\n6. Adverse Reactions/Side Effects\nThe following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling:\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Subjects\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.Serious and Fatal Abacavir-Associated Hypersensitivity ReactionsIn clinical trials, serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with abacavir[seeBoxed Warning,Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. These reactions have been characterized by 2 or more of the following signs or symptoms: (1) fever; (2) rash; (3) gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain); (4) constitutional symptoms (including generalized malaise, fatigue, or achiness); (5) respiratory symptoms (including dyspnea, cough, or pharyngitis). Almost all abacavir hypersensitivity reactions include fever and/or rash as part of the syndrome.Other signs and symptoms have included lethargy, headache, myalgia, edema, arthralgia, and paresthesia. Anaphylaxis, liver failure, renal failure, hypotension, adult respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, myolysis, and death have occurred in association with these hypersensitivity reactions. Physical findings have included lymphadenopathy, mucous membrane lesions (conjunctivitis and mouth ulcerations), and maculopapular or urticarial rash (although some patients had other types of rashes and others did not have a rash). There were reports of erythema multiforme. Laboratory abnormalities included elevated liver chemistries, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevated creatinine, and lymphopenia, and abnormal chest x-ray findings (predominantly infiltrates, which were localized).Additional Adverse Reactions with Use of AbacavirTherapy-Naive Adults:Treatment-emergent clinical adverse reactions (rated by the investigator as moderate or severe) with a greater than or equal to 5% frequency during therapy with abacavir 300 mg twice daily, lamivudine 150 mg twice daily, and efavirenz 600 mg daily compared with zidovudine 300 mg twice daily, lamivudine 150 mg twice daily, and efavirenz 600 mg daily from CNA30024 are listed in Table 2.\nAdverse Reaction\nAbacavir plusLamivudine plus Efavirenz(n = 324)\nZidovudine plusLamivudine plus Efavirenz(n = 325)\nDreams/sleep disorders\n10%\n10%\nDrug hypersensitivity\n9%\n<1%b\nHeadaches/migraine\n7%\n11%\nNausea\n7%\n11%\nFatigue/malaise\n7%\n10%\nDiarrhea\n7%\n6%\nRashes\n6%\n12%\nAbdominal pain/gastritis/gastrointestinal signs and symptoms\n6%\n8%\nDepressive disorders\n6%\n6%\nDizziness\n6%\n6%\nMusculoskeletal pain\n6%\n5%\nBronchitis\n4%\n5%\nVomiting\n2%\n9%\nTreatment-emergent clinical adverse reactions (rated by the investigator as moderate or severe) with a greater than or equal to 5% frequency during therapy with abacavir 300 mg twice daily, lamivudine 150 mg twice daily, and zidovudine 300 mg twice daily compared with indinavir 800 mg 3 times daily, lamivudine 150 mg twice daily, and zidovudine 300 mg twice daily from CNA3005 are listed in Table 3.\nAdverse Reaction\nAbacavir plusLamivudine/Zidovudine(n = 262)\nIndinavir plusLamivudine/Zidovudine(n = 264)\nNausea\n19%\n17%\nHeadache\n13%\n9%\nMalaise and fatigue\n12%\n12%\nNausea and vomiting\n10%\n10%\nHypersensitivity reaction\n8%\n2%\nDiarrhea\n7%\n5%\nFever and/or chills\n6%\n3%\nDepressive disorders\n6%\n4%\nMusculoskeletal pain\n5%\n7%\nSkin rashes\n5%\n4%\nEar/nose/throat infections\n5%\n4%\nViral respiratory infections\n5%\n5%\nAnxiety\n5%\n3%\nRenal signs/symptoms\n<1%\n5%\nPain (non-site-specific)\n<1%\n5%\nFive subjects receiving abacavir in CNA3005 experienced worsening of pre-existing depression compared with none in the indinavir arm. The background rates of pre-existing depression were similar in the 2 treatment arms.Abacavir Once Daily versus Abacavir Twice Daily (CNA30021):Treatment-emergent clinical adverse reactions (rated by the investigator as at least moderate) with a greater than or equal to 5% frequency during therapy with abacavir 600 mg once daily or abacavir 300 mg twice daily, both in combination with lamivudine 300 mg once daily and efavirenz 600 mg once daily from CNA30021, were similar. For hypersensitivity reactions, subjects receiving abacavir once daily showed a rate of 9% in comparison with a rate of 7% for subjects receiving abacavir twice daily. However, subjects receiving abacavir 600 mg once daily experienced a significantly higher incidence of severe drug hypersensitivity reactions and severe diarrhea compared with subjects who received abacavir 300 mg twice daily. Five percent (5%) of subjects receiving abacavir 600 mg once daily had severe drug hypersensitivity reactions compared with 2% of subjects receiving abacavir 300 mg twice daily. Two percent (2%) of subjects receiving abacavir 600 mg once daily had severe diarrhea while none of the subjects receiving abacavir 300 mg twice daily had this event.Laboratory Abnormalities:Laboratory abnormalities (Grades 3 to 4) in therapy-naive adults during therapy with abacavir 300 mg twice daily, lamivudine 150 mg twice daily, and efavirenz 600 mg daily compared with zidovudine 300 mg twice daily, lamivudine 150 mg twice daily, and efavirenz 600 mg daily from CNA30024 are listed in Table 4.\nGrade 3/4Laboratory Abnormalities\nAbacavir plusLamivudine plusEfavirenz(n = 324)\nZidovudine plusLamivudine plusEfavirenz(n = 325)\nElevated CPK (>4 X ULN)\n8%\n8%\nElevated ALT (>5 X ULN)\n6%\n6%\nElevated AST (>5 X ULN)\n6%\n5%\nHypertriglyceridemia (>750 mg/dL)\n6%\n5%\nHyperamylasemia (>2 X ULN)\n4%\n5%\nNeutropenia (ANC <750/mm3)\n2%\n4%\nAnemia (Hgb ≤6.9 gm/dL)\n<1%\n2%\nThrombocytopenia (Platelets <50,000/mm3)\n1%\n<1%\nLeukopenia (WBC ≤1,500/mm3)\n<1%\n2%\nLaboratory abnormalities in CNA3005 are listed in Table 5.\nGrade 3/4 Laboratory Abnormalities\n\nAbacavir plusLamivudine/Zidovudine(n = 262)\nIndinavir plusLamivudine/Zidovudine(n = 264)\nElevated CPK (>4 x ULN)\n18 (7%)\n18 (7%)\nALT (>5 x ULN)\n16 (6%)\n16 (6%)\nNeutropenia (<750/mm3)\n13 (5%)\n13 (5%)\nHypertriglyceridemia (>750 mg/dL)\n5 (2%)\n3 (1%)\nHyperamylasemia (>2 x ULN)\n5 (2%)\n1 (<1%)\nHyperglycemia (>13.9 mmol/L)\n2 (<1%)\n2 (<1%)\nAnemia (Hgb ≤6.9 g/dL)\n0 (0%)\n3 (1%)\nThe frequencies of treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities were comparable between treatment groups in CNA30021.\n6.2 Clinical Trials Experience in Pediatric Subjects\nTherapy-Experienced Pediatric Subjects (Twice-Daily Dosing)\nTreatment-emergent clinical adverse reactions (rated by the investigator as moderate or severe) with a greater than or equal to 5% frequency during therapy with abacavir 8 mg per kg twice daily, lamivudine 4 mg per kg twice daily, and zidovudine 180 mg per m2twice daily compared with lamivudine 4 mg per kg twice daily and zidovudine 180 mg per m2twice daily from CNA3006 are listed in Table 6.\nAdverse Reaction\nAbacavir plus Lamivudine plus Zidovudine(n = 102)\nLamivudine plus Zidovudine(n = 103)\nFever and/or chills\n9%\n7%\nNausea and vomiting\n9%\n2%\nSkin rashes\n7%\n1%\nEar/nose/throat infections\n5%\n1%\nPneumonia\n4%\n5%\nHeadache\n1%\n5%\nLaboratory Abnormalities:In CNA3006, laboratory abnormalities (anemia, neutropenia, liver function test abnormalities, and CPK elevations) were observed with similar frequencies as in a trial of therapy-naive adults (CNA30024). Mild elevations of blood glucose were more frequent in pediatric subjects receiving abacavir (CNA3006) as compared with adult subjects (CNA30024).\nOther Adverse Events\nIn addition to adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported in Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, other adverse reactions observed in the expanded access program were pancreatitis and increased GGT.Pediatric Subjects Once-Daily versus Twice-Daily Dosing (COL105677):The safety of once-daily compared with twice-daily dosing of abacavir was assessed in the ARROW trial. Primary safety assessment in the ARROW trial was based on Grade 3 and Grade 4 adverse events. The frequency of Grade 3 and 4 adverse events was similar among subjects randomized to once-daily dosing compared with subjects randomized to twice-daily dosing. One event of Grade 4 hepatitis in the once-daily cohort was considered as uncertain causality by the investigator and all other Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were considered not related by the investigator.\n6.3 Postmarketing Experience\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of abacavir. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposures.Body as a WholeRedistribution/accumulation of body fat.CardiovascularMyocardial infarction.HepaticLactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2)].SkinSuspected Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients receiving abacavir primarily in combination with medications known to be associated with SJS and TEN, respectively. Because of the overlap of clinical signs and symptoms between hypersensitivity to abacavir and SJS and TEN, and the possibility of multiple drug sensitivities in some patients, abacavir should be discontinued and not restarted in such cases.There have also been reports of erythema multiforme with abacavir use[seeAdverse Reactions (6.1)].\nRelated/similar drugs\nBiktarvy\nBiktarvy is a complete HIV-1 treatment in a once-a-day single tablet containing three antiviral ...\nDescovy\nDescovy is used to treat and prevent HIV infection in adults and adolescents.

Drug Interactions\n7.1 Methadone\nIn a trial of 11 HIV-1-infected subjects receiving methadone-maintenance therapy with 600 mg of abacavir twice daily (twice the currently recommended dose), oral methadone clearance increased[seeClinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. This alteration will not result in a methadone dose modification in the majority of patients; however, an increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients.\n7.2 Riociguat\nCoadministration with fixed-dose abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine resulted in increased riociguat exposure, which may increase the risk of riociguat adverse reactions[seeClinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The riociguat dose may need to be reduced. See full prescribing information for ADEMPAS (riociguat).\nDoes Abacavir interact with my other drugs?\nEnter medications to view a detailed interaction report using ourDrug Interaction Checker.\n8. Use In Specific Populations\n8.1 Pregnancy\nPregnancy Exposure Registry\nThere is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to abacavir during pregnancy. Healthcare Providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) at 1-800-258-4263.\nRisk Summary\nAvailable data from the APR show no difference in the overall risk of birth defects for abacavir compared with the background rate for birth defects of 2.7% in the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) reference population(see Data). The APR uses the MACDP as the U.S. reference population for birth defects in the general population. The MACDP evaluates women and infants from a limited geographic area and does not include outcomes for births that occurred at less than 20 weeks’ gestation. The rate of miscarriage is not reported in the APR. The estimated background rate of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies in the U.S. general population is 15% to 20%. The background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.\nIn animal reproduction studies, oral administration of abacavir to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in fetal malformations and other embryonic and fetal toxicities at exposures 35 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical daily dose. However, no adverse developmental effects were observed following oral administration of abacavir to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis, at exposures approximately 9 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose(see Data).\nData\nHuman Data:Based on prospective reports to the APR of exposures to abacavir during pregnancy resulting in live births (including over 1,300 exposed in the first trimester and over 1,300 exposed in second/third trimester), there was no difference between the overall risk of birth defects for abacavir compared with the background birth defect rate of 2.7% in the U.S. reference population of the MACDP. The prevalence of defects in live births was 3.2% (95% CI: 2.3% to 4.3%) following first trimester exposure to abacavir-containing regimens and 2.9% (95% CI: 2.1% to 4%) following second/third trimester exposure to abacavir-containing regimens.Abacavir has been shown to cross the placenta and concentrations in neonatal plasma at birth were essentially equal to those in maternal plasma at delivery[seeClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\nAnimal Data:Abacavir was administered orally to pregnant rats (at 100, 300, and 1,000 mg per kg per day) and rabbits (at 125, 350, or 700 mg per kg per day) during organogenesis (on Gestation Days 6 through 17 and 6 through 20, respectively). Fetal malformations (increased incidences of fetal anasarca and skeletal malformations) or developmental toxicity (decreased fetal body weight and crown-rump length) were observed in rats at doses up to 1,000 mg per kg per day, resulting in exposures approximately 35 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended daily dose. No developmental effects were observed in rats at 100 mg per kg per day, resulting in exposures (AUC) 3.5 times the human exposure at the recommended daily dose. In a fertility and early embryo-fetal development study conducted in rats (at 60, 160, or 500 mg per kg per day), embryonic and fetal toxicities (increased resorptions, decreased fetal body weights) or toxicities to the offspring (increased incidence of stillbirth and lower body weights) occurred at doses up to 500 mg per kg per day. No developmental effects were observed in rats at 60 mg per kg per day, resulting in exposures (AUC) approximately 4 times the human exposure at the recommended daily dose. Studies in pregnant rats showed that abacavir is transferred to the fetus through the placenta. In pregnant rabbits, no developmental toxicities and no increases in fetal malformations occurred at up to the highest dose evaluated, resulting in exposures (AUC) approximately 9 times the human exposure at the recommended dose.\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV-1-infected mothers in the United States not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV-1 infection. Abacavir is present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of abacavir on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Because of the potential for (1) HIV-1 transmission (in HIV-negative infants), (2) developing viral resistance (in HIV-positive infants), and (3) adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving abacavir.\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of abacavir have been established in pediatric patients aged 3 months and older. Use of abacavir is supported by pharmacokinetic trials and evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials of abacavir in adults and pediatric subjects[seeDosage and Administration (2.3),Adverse Reactions (6.2),Clinical Pharmacology (12.3),Clinical Studies (14.2)].\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nClinical trials of abacavir did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, caution should be exercised in the administration of abacavir in elderly patients reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.\n8.6 Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function\nA dose reduction is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A)[seeDosage and Administration (2.4)]. The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir have not been established in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment; therefore, abacavir is contraindicated in these patients[seeContraindications (4),Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n10. Overdosage\nThere is no known specific treatment for overdose with abacavir. If overdose occurs, the patient should be monitored and standard supportive treatment applied as required. It is not known whether abacavir can be removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis.\n11. Abacavir Sulfate Tablets Description\nAbacavir sulfate is a synthetic carbocyclic nucleoside analogue with inhibitory activity against HIV-1. The chemical name of abacavir sulfate is(1S,cis)-4-[2-amino-6-(cyclopropylamino)-9H-purin-9-yl]-2-cyclopentene-1-methanol sulfate (salt) (2:1). Abacavir sulfate is the enantiomer with1S,4Rabsolute configuration on the cyclopentene ring. It has a molecular formula of (C14H18N6O)2•H2SO4and a molecular weight of 670.76 g per mol. It has the following structural formula:\nAbacavir sulfate USP is a white to off-white solid and is soluble in water.Abacavir tablets USP are for oral administration. Each tablet contains abacavir sulfate USP equivalent to 300 mg of abacavir as active ingredient and the following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, and sodium starch glycolate. The tablets are coated with a film that is made of hypromellose, iron oxide yellow, polysorbate 80, titanium dioxide, and triacetin.In vivo,abacavir sulfate dissociates to its free base, abacavir. Dosages are expressed in terms of abacavir.\n12. Abacavir Sulfate Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nAbacavir is an antiretroviral agent[seeMicrobiology (12.4)].\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nPharmacokinetics in Adults\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir were independent of dose over the range of 300 to 1,200 mg per day.\nAbsorption:Following oral administration, abacavir is rapidly absorbed and extensively distributed. The geometric mean absolute bioavailability of the tablet was 83%. Plasma abacavir AUC was similar following administration of the oral solution or tablets. After oral administration of 300 mg twice daily in 20 subjects, the steady-state peak serum abacavir concentration (Cmax) was 3 ± 0.89 mcg per mL (mean ± SD) and AUC(0-12 h)was 6.02 ± 1.73 mcg•hour per mL. After oral administration of a single dose of 600 mg of abacavir in 20 subjects, Cmaxwas 4.26 ± 1.19 mcg per mL (mean ± SD) and AUC∞ was  11.95 ± 2.51 mcg•hour per mL.\nEffect of Food:Bioavailability of abacavir tablets was assessed in the fasting and fed states with no significant difference in systemic exposure (AUC∞); therefore, abacavir tablets may be administered with or without food. Systemic exposure to abacavir was comparable after administration of abacavir oral solution and abacavir tablets. Therefore, these products may be used interchangeably.\nDistribution:The apparent volume of distribution after IV administration of abacavir was 0.86 ± 0.15 L per kg, suggesting that abacavir distributes into extravascular space. In 3 subjects, the CSF AUC(0-6 h)to plasma abacavir AUC(0-6 h)ratio ranged from 27% to 33%.\nBinding of abacavir to human plasma proteins is approximately 50% and was independent of concentration. Total blood and plasma drug-related radioactivity concentrations are identical, demonstrating that abacavir readily distributes into erythrocytes.\nElimination:In single-dose trials, the observed elimination half-life (t1/2) was 1.54 ± 0.63 hours. After intravenous administration, total clearance was 0.8 ± 0.24 L per hour per kg (mean ± SD).Metabolism:In humans, abacavir is not significantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. The primary routes of elimination of abacavir are metabolism by alcohol dehydrogenase to form the 5′-carboxylic acid and glucuronyl transferase to form the 5′-glucuronide. The metabolites do not have antiviral activity.In vitroexperiments reveal that abacavir does not inhibit human CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP2C9 activity at clinically relevant concentrations.Excretion:Elimination of abacavir was quantified in a mass balance trial following administration of a 600 mg dose of14C-abacavir: 99% of the radioactivity was recovered, 1.2% was excreted in the urine as abacavir, 30% as the 5′-carboxylic acid metabolite, 36% as the 5′-glucuronide metabolite, and 15% as unidentified minor metabolites in the urine. Fecal elimination accounted for 16% of the dose.Specific PopulationsPatients with Renal Impairment:The pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir have not been determined in patients with impaired renal function. Renal excretion of unchanged abacavir is a minor route of elimination in humans.Patients with Hepatic Impairment:The pharmacokinetics of abacavir have been studied in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A). Results showed that there was a mean increase of 89% in the abacavir AUC and an increase of 58% in the half-life of abacavir after a single dose of 600 mg of abacavir. The AUCs of the metabolites were not modified by mild liver disease; however, the rates of formation and elimination of the metabolites were decreased[seeContraindications (4),Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].Pregnant Women:Abacavir pharmacokinetics were studied in 25 pregnant women during the last trimester of pregnancy receiving abacavir 300 mg twice daily. Abacavir exposure (AUC) during pregnancy was similar to those in postpartum and in HIV-infected non-pregnant historical controls. Consistent with passive diffusion of abacavir across the placenta, abacavir concentrations in neonatal plasma cord samples at birth were essentially equal to those in maternal plasma at delivery.Pediatric Patients:The pharmacokinetics of abacavir have been studied after either single or repeat doses of abacavir in 169 pediatric subjects. Subjects receiving abacavir oral solution according to the recommended dosage regimen achieved plasma concentrations of abacavir similar to adults. Subjects receiving abacavir oral tablets achieved higher plasma concentrations of abacavir than subjects receiving oral solution.The pharmacokinetics of abacavir dosed once daily in HIV-1-infected pediatric subjects   aged 3 months through 12 years was evaluated in 3 trials (PENTA 13 [n = 14], PENTA 15  [n = 18], and ARROW [n = 36]). All 3 trials were 2-period, crossover, open-label pharmacokinetic trials of twice-versus once-daily dosing of abacavir and lamivudine. For the oral solution as well as the tablet formulation, these 3 trials demonstrated that  once-daily dosing provides comparable AUC0-24to twice-daily dosing of abacavir at the same total daily dose. The mean Cmaxwas approximately 1.6- to 2.3-fold higher with abacavir once-daily dosing compared with twice-daily dosing.Geriatric Patients:The pharmacokinetics of abacavir have not been studied in subjects older than 65 years.Male and Female Patients:A population pharmacokinetic analysis in HIV-1-infected male (n = 304) and female (n = 67) subjects showed no gender differences in abacavir AUC normalized for lean body weight.Racial Groups:There are no significant or clinically relevant racial differences between blacks and whites in abacavir pharmacokinetics.Drug Interaction StudiesEffect of Abacavir on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Agents:In vitrostudies have shown that abacavir has potential to inhibit CYP1A1 and limited potential to inhibit metabolism mediated by CYP3A4. Abacavir did not inhibit or induce other CYP enzymes (such as CYP2C9, or CYP2D6).Based onin vitrostudy results, abacavir at therapeutic drug exposures is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are substrates of the following transporters: organic anion transporter polypeptide (OATP)1B1/3, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) or P-glycoprotein (P-gp), organic cation transporter (OCT)1, OCT2, or multidrug and toxic extrusion protein (MATE)1 and MATE2-K.Riociguat:Coadministration of a single dose of riociguat (0.5 mg) to HIV-1–infected subjects receiving fixed-dose abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine is reported to increase riociguat AUC(∞)compared with riociguat AUC(∞)reported in healthy subjects due to CYP1A1 inhibition by abacavir. The exact magnitude of increase in riociguat exposure has not been fully characterized based on findings from two studies[seeDrug Interactions (7.2)].Effect of Other Agents on the Pharmacokinetics of Abacavir:  In vitro, abacavir is not a substrate of OATP1B1, OAP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, MATE1, MATE2-K, multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)2 or MRP4; therefore, drugs that modulate these transporters are not expected to affect abacavir plasma concentrations. Abacavir is a substrate of BCRP and P-gpin vitro; however, considering its absolute bioavailability (83%), modulators of these transporters are unlikely to result in a clinically relevant impact on abacavir concentrations.Lamivudine and/or Zidovudine:Fifteen HIV-1-infected subjects were enrolled in a crossover-designed drug interaction trial evaluating single doses of abacavir (600 mg), lamivudine (150 mg), and zidovudine (300 mg) alone or in combination. Analysis showed no clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of abacavir with the addition of lamivudine or zidovudine or the combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. Lamivudine exposure (AUC decreased 15%) and zidovudine exposure (AUC increased 10%) did not show clinically relevant changes with concurrent abacavir.Ethanol:Abacavir has no effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of ethanol. Ethanol decreases the elimination of abacavir causing an increase in overall exposure. Due to the common metabolic pathways of abacavir and ethanol via alcohol dehydrogenase, the pharmacokinetic interaction between abacavir and ethanol was studied in 24 HIV-1-infected male subjects. Each subject received the following treatments on separate occasions: a single 600 mg dose of abacavir, 0.7 g per kg ethanol (equivalent to 5 alcoholic drinks), and abacavir 600 mg plus 0.7 g per kg ethanol. Coadministration of ethanol and abacavir resulted in a 41% increase in abacavir AUC∞and a 26% increase in abacavir t1/2. Abacavir had no effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of ethanol, so no clinically significant interaction is expected in men. This interaction has not been studied in females.\nMethadone:In a trial of 11 HIV-1-infected subjects receiving methadone-maintenance therapy (40 mg and 90 mg daily), with 600 mg of abacavir twice daily (twice the currently recommended dose), oral methadone clearance increased 22% (90% CI: 6% to 42%). This alteration will not result in a methadone dose modification in the majority of patients; however, an increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients[seeDrug Interactions (7)]. The addition of methadone had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir.\n12.4 Microbiology\nAbacavir is a carbocyclic synthetic nucleoside analogue. Abacavir is converted by cellular enzymes to the active metabolite, carbovir triphosphate (CBV-TP), an analogue of deoxyguanosine-5′-triphosphate (dGTP). CBV-TP inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) both by competing with the natural substrate dGTP and by its incorporation into viral DNA.Antiviral ActivityThe antiviral activity of abacavir against HIV-1 was assessed in a number of cell lines including primary monocytes/macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). EC50values ranged from 3.7 to 5.8 microM (1 microM = 0.28 mcg per mL) and 0.07 to 1 microM against HIV-1IIIBand HIV-1BaL, respectively, and the mean EC50value was 0.26 ± 0.18 microM against 8 clinical isolates. The median EC50values of abacavir were 344 nM (range: 14.8 to 676 nM), 16.9 nM (range: 5.9 to 27.9 nM), 8.1 nM (range: 1.5 to 16.7 nM), 356 nM (range: 35.7 to 396 nM), 105 nM (range: 28.1 to 168 nM), 47.6 nM (range: 5.2 to 200 nM), 51.4 nM (range: 7.1 to 177 nM), and 282 nM (range: 22.4 to 598 nM) against HIV-1 clades A-G and group O viruses (n = 3 except n = 2 for clade B), respectively. The EC50values against HIV-2 isolates (n = 4), ranged from 0.024 to 0.49 microM. The antiviral activity of abacavir in cell culture was not antagonized when combined with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, zalcitabine or zidovudine, the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) nevirapine, or the protease inhibitor (PI) amprenavir. Ribavirin (50 microM) used in the treatment of chronic HCV infection had no effect on the anti–HIV-1 activity of abacavir in cell culture.ResistanceHIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to abacavir have been selected in cell culture. Genotypic analysis of isolates selected in cell culture and recovered from abacavir-treated subjects demonstrated that amino acid substitutions K65R, L74V, Y115F, and M184V/I emerged in HIV-1 RT. M184V or I substitutions resulted in an approximately 2-fold decrease in susceptibility to abacavir. Substitutions K65R, L74M, or Y115F with M184V or I conferred a 7-to 8-fold reduction in abacavir susceptibility, and combinations of three substitutions were required to confer more than an 8-fold reduction in susceptibility.Thirty-nine percent (7 of 18) of the isolates from subjects who experienced virologic failure in the abacavir once-daily arm had a greater than 2.5-fold mean decrease in abacavir susceptibility with a median-fold decrease of 1.3 (range: 0.5 to 11) compared with 29% (5 of 17) of the failure isolates in the twice-daily arm with a median-fold decrease of 0.92 (range: 0.7 to 13).Cross-ResistanceCross-resistance has been observed among NRTIs. Isolates containing abacavir resistance-associated substitutions, namely, K65R, L74V, Y115F, and M184V, exhibited cross-resistance to didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, and tenofovir in cell culture and in subjects. An increasing number of thymidine analogue mutation substitutions (TAMs: M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, K219E/R/H/Q/N) is associated with a progressive reduction in abacavir susceptibility.\n13. Nonclinical Toxicology\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenicityAbacavir was administered orally at 3 dosage levels to separate groups of mice and rats in 2-year carcinogenicity studies. Results showed an increase in the incidence of malignant and non-malignant tumors. Malignant tumors occurred in the preputial gland of males and the clitoral gland of females of both species, and in the liver of female rats. In addition, non-malignant tumors also occurred in the liver and thyroid gland of female rats. These observations were made at systemic exposures in the range of 6 to 32 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 600 mg.MutagenicityAbacavir induced chromosomal aberrations both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation in anin vitrocytogenetic study in human lymphocytes. Abacavir was mutagenic in the absence of metabolic activation, although it was not mutagenic in the presence of metabolic activation in an L5178Y mouse lymphoma assay. Abacavir was clastogenic in males and not clastogenic in females in anin vivomouse bone marrow micronucleus assay.Abacavir was not mutagenic in bacterial mutagenicity assays in the presence and absence of metabolic activation.Impairment of FertilityAbacavir did not affect male or female fertility in rats at a dose associated with exposures (AUC) approximately 3.3 times (male) or 4.1 times (female) those in humans at the clinically recommended dose.\n13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology\nMyocardial degeneration was found in mice and rats following administration of abacavir for 2 years. The systemic exposures were equivalent to 7 to 24 times the expected systemic exposure in humans at a dose of 600 mg. The clinical relevance of this finding has not been determined.\n14. Clinical Studies\n14.1 Adult Trials\nTherapy-Naive AdultsCNA30024 was a multicenter, double-blind, controlled trial in which 649 HIV-1-infected, therapy-naive adults were randomized and received either abacavir (300 mg twice daily), lamivudine (150 mg twice daily), and efavirenz (600 mg once daily); or zidovudine (300 mg twice daily), lamivudine (150 mg twice daily), and efavirenz (600 mg once daily). The duration of double-blind treatment was at least 48 weeks. Trial participants were male (81%), white (51%), black (21%), and Hispanic (26%). The median age was 35 years; the median pretreatment CD4+ cell count was 264 cells per mm3, and median plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.79 log10copies per mL. The outcomes of randomized treatment are provided in Table 7.\nOutcome\nAbacavir plusLamivudine plusEfavirenz(n = 324)\nZidovudine plusLamivudine plusEfavirenz(n = 325)\nRespondera\n69% (73%)\n69% (71%)\nVirologic failuresb\n6%\n4%\nDiscontinued due to adverse reactions\n14%\n16%\nDiscontinued due to other reasonsc\n10%\n11%\nAfter 48 weeks of therapy, the median CD4+ cell count increases from baseline were 209 cells per mm3in the group receiving abacavir and 155 cells per mm3in the zidovudine group. Through Week 48, 8 subjects (2%) in the group receiving abacavir (5 CDC classification C events and 3 deaths) and 5 subjects (2%) on the zidovudine arm (3 CDC classification C events and 2 deaths) experienced clinical disease progression.CNA3005 was a multicenter, double-blind, controlled trial in which 562 HIV-1-infected, therapy-naive adults were randomized to receive either abacavir (300 mg twice daily) plus COMBIVIR (lamivudine 150 mg/zidovudine 300 mg twice daily), or indinavir (800 mg 3 times a day) plus COMBIVIR twice daily. The trial was stratified at randomization by pre-entry plasma HIV-1 RNA 10,000 to 100,000 copies per mL and plasma HIV-1 RNA greater than 100,000 copies per mL. Trial participants were male (87%), white (73%), black (15%), and Hispanic (9%). At baseline the median age was 36 years; the median baseline CD4+ cell count was 360 cells per mm3, and median baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.8 log10copies per mL. Proportions of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 400 copies per mL (using Roche AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR Test) through 48 weeks of treatment are summarized in Table 8.\nOutcome\nAbacavir plusLamivudine/Zidovudine(n = 262)\nIndinavir plusLamivudine/Zidovudine(n = 265)\nRespondera\n49%\n50%\nVirologic failureb\n31%\n28%\nDiscontinued due to adverse reactions\n10%\n12%\nDiscontinued due to other reasonsc\n11%\n10%\nTreatment response by plasma HIV-1 RNA strata is shown in Table 9.\nScreeningHIV-1 RNA(copies/mL)\nAbacavir plusLamivudine/Zidovudine(n = 262)\nIndinavir plusLamivudine/Zidovudine(n = 265)\n<400 copies/mL\nn\n<400 copies/mL\nn\n≥10,000 to ≤100,000>100,000\n50%48%\n16696\n48%52%\n165100\nIn subjects with baseline viral load greater than 100,000 copies per mL, percentages of subjects with HIV-1 RNA levels less than 50 copies per mL were 31% in the group receiving abacavir versus 45% in the group receiving indinavir.Through Week 48, an overall mean increase in CD4+ cell count of about 150 cells per mm3was observed in both treatment arms. Through Week 48, 9 subjects (3.4%) in the group receiving abacavir (6 CDC classification C events and 3 deaths) and 3 subjects (1.5%) in the group receiving indinavir (2 CDC classification C events and 1 death) experienced clinical disease progression.CNA30021 was an international, multicenter, double-blind, controlled trial in which 770 HIV-1-infected, therapy-naive adults were randomized and received either abacavir 600 mg once daily or abacavir 300 mg twice daily, both in combination with lamivudine 300 mg once daily and efavirenz 600 mg once daily. The double-blind treatment duration was at least 48 weeks. Trial participants had a mean age of 37 years; were male (81%), white (54%), black (27%), and American Hispanic (15%). The median baseline CD4+ cell count was 262 cells per mm3(range: 21 to 918 cells per mm3) and the median baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.89 log10copies per mL (range: 2.6 to 6.99 log10copies per mL).The outcomes of randomized treatment are provided in Table 10.\nOutcome\nAbacavir 600 mgq.d. plus EPIVIR plusEfavirenz(n = 384)\nAbacavir 300 mgb.i.d. plus EPIVIR plusEfavirenz(n = 386)\nRespondera\n64% (71%)\n65% (72%)\nVirologic failureb\n11% (5%)\n11% (5%)\nDiscontinued due to adverse reactions\n13%\n11%\nDiscontinued due to other reasonsc\n11%\n13%\nAfter 48 weeks of therapy, the median CD4+ cell count increases from baseline were 188 cells per mm3in the group receiving abacavir 600 mg once daily and 200 cells per mm3in the group receiving abacavir 300 mg twice daily. Through Week 48, 6 subjects (2%) in the group receiving abacavir 600 mg once daily (4 CDC classification C events and 2 deaths) and 10 subjects (3%) in the group receiving abacavir 300 mg twice daily (7 CDC classification C events and 3 deaths) experienced clinical disease progression. None of the deaths were attributed to trial medications.\n14.2 Pediatric Trials\nTherapy-Experienced Pediatric Subjects\nCNA3006 was a randomized, double-blind trial comparing abacavir 8 mg per kg twice daily plus lamivudine 4 mg per kg twice daily plus zidovudine 180 mg per m2twice daily versus lamivudine 4 mg per kg twice daily plus zidovudine 180 mg per m2twice daily. Two hundred and five therapy-experienced pediatric subjects were  enrolled: female (56%), white (17%), black (50%), Hispanic (30%), median age of 5.4 years, baseline CD4+ cell percent greater than 15% (median = 27%), and median baseline  plasma HIV-1 RNA of 4.6 log10copies per mL. Eighty percent and 55% of subjects had prior therapy with zidovudine and lamivudine, respectively, most often in combination. The median duration of prior nucleoside analogue therapy was 2 years. At 16 weeks, the proportion of  subjects responding based on plasma HIV-1 RNA less than or equal to 400 copies per mL was significantly higher in subjects receiving abacavir plus lamivudine plus zidovudine compared  with subjects receiving lamivudine plus zidovudine, 13% versus 2%, respectively. Median plasma HIV-1 RNA changes from baseline were -0.53 log10copies per mL in the group receiving abacavir plus lamivudine plus zidovudine compared with -0.21 log10copies per mL in the group receiving lamivudine plus zidovudine. Median CD4+ cell count increases from baseline were 69 cells per mm3in the group receiving abacavir plus lamivudine plus zidovudine and 9 cells per mm3in the group receiving lamivudine plus zidovudine.\nOnce-Daily Dosing\nARROW (COL105677) was a 5-year randomized, multicenter trial which evaluated multiple aspects of clinical management of HIV-1 infection in pediatric subjects. HIV-1–infected, treatment-naive subjects aged 3 months to 17 years were enrolled and treated with a first-line regimen containing abacavir and lamivudine, dosed twice daily according to World Health  Organization recommendations. After a minimum of 36 weeks of treatment, subjects were given the option to participate in Randomization 3 of the ARROW trial, comparing the safety and efficacy of once-daily dosing with twice-daily dosing of abacavir and lamivudine, in  combination with a third antiretroviral drug, for an additional 96 weeks. Of the 1,206 original ARROW subjects, 669 participated in Randomization 3. Virologic suppression was not a requirement for participation at baseline for Randomization 3 (following a minimum of 36 weeks of twice-daily treatment), 75% of subjects in the twice-daily cohort were virologically suppressed compared with 71% of subjects in the once-daily cohort.The proportions of subjects with HIV-1 RNA less than 80 copies per mL through 96 weeks are shown in Table 11. The differences between virologic responses in the two treatment arms were comparable across baseline characteristics for gender and age.\nOutcome\nAbacavir plusLamivudineTwice-Daily Dosing (n = 333)\nAbacavir plusLamivudineOnce-Daily Dosing(n = 336)\nHIV-1 RNA <80 copies/mLbHIV-1 RNA ≥80 copies/mLcNo virologic dataDiscontinued due to adverse event or deathDiscontinued study for other reasonsdMissing data during window but on study\n70%28%1%0%1%\n67%31%<1%<1%1%\n16.

If appropriate, initiation ofanti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)].\n1. Indications and Usage for Abacavir, Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets\nAbacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablet is indicated in combination with other antiretrovirals or alone for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.\nLimitations of Use:\nLimited data exist on the use of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine      tablets alone in patients with higher      baseline viral      load levels (greater than      100,000 copies per      mL)[see CLINICAL STUDIES (14)].\n2. Abacavir, Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets Dosage and Administration\n2.1 Screening for HLA-B*5701 Allele prior to Starting Abacavir, Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets\nScreen for the HLA-B*5701 allele prior to initiating therapy with abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets[seeBOXED WARNING, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)].\n2.2 Recommended Dosage for Adults and Pediatric Patients Weighing at Least 40 kg\nThe recommended dosage of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablet is one tablet taken orally twice daily with or without food.\n2.3 Not Recommended Due to Lack of Dosage Adjustment\nBecause abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablet is a fixed-dose tablet and cannot be dose adjusted, abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablet is not recommended for:\npediatric patients who weigh      less than 40 kg[see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS      (8.4)].patients with creatinine clearance      less than 50 mL per      minute[see      USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6)].patients with mild hepatic      impairment.      Abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablet is contraindicated in patients with moderate or      severe      hepatic impairment[see CONTRAINDICATIONS      (4),      USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.7)].\n3. Dosage Forms and Strengths\nAbacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets contain 300 mg of abacavir as abacavir sulfate, 150 mg of lamivudine, and 300 mg of zidovudine. The tablets are blue-green colored, oval shaped, biconvex, film-coated, debossed with \"LU\" on one side and \"N51\" on the other side.\n4. Contraindications\nAbacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets are contraindicated in patients:\nwho have the HLA-B*5701 allele[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)].with prior hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)],lamivudine, or zidovudine.with moderate or severe hepatic impairment[see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.7)].\n5. Warnings and Precautions\n5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions\nSerious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with abacavir, a component of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. These hypersensitivity reactions have included multi-organ failure and anaphylaxis and typically occurred within the first 6 weeks of treatment with abacavir (median time to onset was 9 days); although abacavir hypersensitivity reactions have occurred any time during treatment[see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. Patients who carry the HLA-B*5701 allele are at a higher risk of abacavir hypersensitivity reactions; although, patients who do not carry the HLA-B*5701 allele have developed hypersensitivity reactions. Hypersensitivity to abacavir was reported in approximately 206 (8%) of 2,670 patients in 9 clinical trials with abacavir-containing products where HLA-B*5701 screening was not performed. The incidence of suspected abacavir hypersensitivity reactions in clinical trials was 1% when subjects carrying the HLA-B*5701 allele were excluded. In any patient treated with abacavir, the clinical diagnosis of hypersensitivity reaction must remain the basis of clinical decision making.\nDue to the potential for severe, serious, and possibly fatal hypersensitivity reactions with abacavir:\nAll patients should be screened for the HLA-B*5701 allele prior to      initiating therapy with abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets or      reinitiation of therapy with abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets,      unless patients have a previously documented HLA-B*5701 allele assessment.Abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine tablets are contraindicated in patients with a      prior hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir and in HLA-B*5701-positive      patients.Before starting abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets,      review medical history for prior exposure to any abacavir-containing      product. NEVER restart abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets or any      other abacavir-containing product following a hypersensitivity reaction to      abacavir, regardless of HLA-B*5701 status.To reduce the risk of a life-threatening hypersensitivity      reaction, regardless of HLA-B*5701 status, discontinue abacavir,      lamivudine and zidovudine tablets immediately if a hypersensitivity      reaction is suspected, even when other diagnoses are possible (e.g., acute      onset respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis, pharyngitis, or      influenza; gastroenteritis; or reactions to other medications).If a hypersensitivity reaction cannot be ruled out, do not restart      abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets or any other      abacavir-containing products because more severe symptoms, which may      include life-threatening hypotension and death, can occur within hours.If a hypersensitivity reaction is ruled out, patients may restart abacavir,      lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. Rarely, patients who have stopped      abacavir for reasons other than symptoms of hypersensitivity have also      experienced life-threatening reactions within hours of reinitiating      abacavir therapy. Therefore, reintroduction of abacavir, lamivudine and      zidovudine tablets or any other abacavir-containing product is recommended      only if medical care can be readily accessed.A Medication Guide and Warning Card that provide information about      recognition of abacavir hypersensitivity reactions should be dispensed      with each new prescription and refill.\n5.2 Hematologic Toxicity/Bone Marrow Suppression\nZidovudine, a component of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablet, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. Abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells per mm3or hemoglobin less than 9.5 grams per dL[see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)].\nFrequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed.\n5.3 Myopathy\nMyopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets.\n5.4 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis\nLactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues, including abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine (components of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets). A majority of these cases have been in women. Female sex and obesity may be risk factors for the development of lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis in patients treated with antiretroviral nucleoside analogues. See full prescribing information for ZIAGEN®(abacavir), EPIVIR®(lamivudine), and RETROVIR®(zidovudine). Treatment with abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).\n5.5 Patients with Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection\nPosttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis\nClinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR®(lamivudine). Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment.\nEmergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV\nSafety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in subjects dually infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has been reported in HIV–1-infected subjects who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR®(lamivudine).\n5.6 Use with Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens\nPatients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. See full prescribing information for RETROVIR®(zidovudine). Discontinuation of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6) (see full prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin).\nExacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablet is not advised.\n5.7 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome\nImmune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such asMycobacterium aviuminfection, cytomegalovirus,Pneumocystis jiroveciipneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.\nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-BarrÉ syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.\n5.8 Lipoatrophy\nTreatment with zidovudine, a component of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets, has been associated with loss of subcutaneous fat. The incidence and severity of lipoatrophy are related to cumulative exposure. This fat loss, which is most evident in the face, limbs, and buttocks, may be only partially reversible and improvement may take months to years after switching to a non-zidovudine-containing regimen. Patients should be regularly assessed for signs of lipoatrophy during therapy with zidovudine-containing products, and if feasible, therapy should be switched to an alternative regimen if there is suspicion of lipoatrophy.\n5.9 Myocardial Infarction\nSeveral prospective, observational, epidemiological studies have reported an association with the use of abacavir and the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). Meta-analyses of randomized, controlled clinical trials have observed no excess risk of MI in abacavir-treated subjects as compared with control subjects. To date, there is no established biological mechanism to explain a potential increase in risk. In totality, the available data from the observational studies and from controlled clinical trials show inconsistency; therefore, evidence for a causal relationship between abacavir treatment and the risk of MI is inconclusive.\nAs a precaution, the underlying risk of coronary heart disease should be considered when prescribing antiretroviral therapies, including abacavir, and action taken to minimize all modifiable risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).\n5.10 Therapy-Experienced Patients\nIn clinical trials, subjects with prolonged prior nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) exposure or who had HIV-1 isolates that contained multiple mutations conferring resistance to NRTIs had limited response to abacavir. The potential for cross-resistance between abacavir and other NRTIs should be considered when choosing new therapeutic regimens in therapy- experienced patients[see Microbiology (12.4)].\n6. Adverse Reactions/Side Effects\nThe following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling:\nSerious and sometimes fatal      hypersensitivity reactions[seeBOXED WARNING,      WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)].Hematologic toxicity, including      neutropenia and anemia[seeBOXED WARNING,      WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)].Symptomatic myopathy[seeBOXED      WARNING, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)].Lactic acidosis and severe      hepatomegaly with steatosis[seeBOXED      WARNING, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)].Exacerbations of hepatitis B[seeBOXED WARNING, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)].Hepatic decompensation in      patients co-infected with HIV-1 and hepatitis C[see WARNINGS AND      PRECAUTIONS (5.6)].Exacerbation of anemia in      HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine[see      WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6)].Immune reconstitution syndrome[see      WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7)].Lipoatrophy[see WARNINGS      AND PRECAUTIONS (5.8)].Myocardial infarction[see      WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.9)].\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.\nSerious and Fatal Abacavir-Associated Hypersensitivity Reactions\nIn clinical trials, serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with abacavir, a component of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets[seeBOXED WARNING, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)].These reactions have been characterized by 2 or more of the following signs or symptoms: (1) fever; (2) rash; (3) gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain); (4) constitutional symptoms (including generalized malaise, fatigue, or achiness); (5) respiratory symptoms (including dyspnea, cough, or pharyngitis). Almost all abacavir hypersensitivity reactions include fever and/or rash as part of the syndrome.\nOther signs and symptoms have included lethargy, headache, myalgia, edema, arthralgia, and paresthesia. Anaphylaxis, liver failure, renal failure, hypotension, adult respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, myolysis, and death have occurred in association with these hypersensitivity reactions. Physical findings have included lymphadenopathy, mucous membrane lesions (conjunctivitis and mouth ulcerations), and maculopapular or urticarial rash (although some patients had other types of rashes and others did not have a rash). There were reports of erythema multiforme. Laboratory abnormalities included elevated liver chemistries, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevated creatinine, and lymphopenia, and abnormal chest x-ray findings (predominantly infiltrates, which were localized).\nAdditional Adverse Reactions with Use of Abacavir, Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets\nTreatment-emergent clinical adverse reactions (rated by the investigator as moderate or severe) with a frequency greater than or equal to 5% during therapy with abacavir 300 mg twice daily, lamivudine 150 mg twice daily, and zidovudine 300 mg twice daily compared with indinavir 800 mg 3 times daily, lamivudine 150 mg twice daily, and zidovudine 300 mg twice daily from CNA3005 are listed in Table 1.\nFive subjects receiving abacavir in CNA3005 experienced worsening of pre-existing depression compared to none in the indinavir arm. The background rates of pre-existing depression were similar in the 2 treatment arms.\nLaboratory Abnormalities\nLaboratory abnormalities in CNA3005 are listed in Table 2.\nULN = Upper limit of normal.\nn = Number of subjects assessed.\nOther Adverse Events\nIn addition to adverse reactions in Tables 1 and 2, other adverse events observed in the expanded access program for abacavir were pancreatitis and increased GGT.\n6.2 Postmarketing Experience\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\nAbacavir\nCardiovascular:\nMyocardial infarction.\n\nSkin:\nSuspected Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients receiving abacavir primarily in combination with medications known to be associated with SJS and TEN, respectively. Because of the overlap of clinical signs and symptoms between hypersensitivity to abacavir and SJS and TEN, and the possibility of multiple drug sensitivities in some patients, abacavir should be discontinued and not restarted in such cases. There have also been reports of erythema multiforme with abacavir use[see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)].\nAbacavir, Lamivudine, and/or Zidovudine\nBody as a Whole:\nRedistribution/accumulation of body fat.\nCardiovascular:\nCardiomyopathy.\nDigestive:\nStomatitis.\nEndocrine and Metabolic:\nGynecomastia.\nGastrointestinal:\nAnorexia and/or decreased appetite, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, oral mucosal pigmentation.\n\nGeneral:\nVasculitis, weakness.\nHemic and Lymphatic:\nAplastic anemia, anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy), lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia.\nHepatic:\nLactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)], elevated bilirubin, elevated transaminases, posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis B[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)].\nHypersensitivity:\nSensitization reactions (including anaphylaxis), urticaria.\nMusculoskeletal:\nArthralgia, myalgia, muscle weakness, rhabdomyolysis.\nNervous:\nDizziness, paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy, seizures.\nPsychiatric:\nInsomnia and other sleep disorders.\nRespiratory:\nAbnormal breath sounds/wheezing.\nSkin:\nAlopecia, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.\nRelated/similar drugs\nBiktarvy\nBiktarvy is a complete HIV-1 treatment in a once-a-day single tablet containing three antiviral ...\nDescovy\nDescovy is used to treat and prevent HIV infection in adults and adolescents.

Drug Interactions\n7.1 Abacavir\nMethadone\nIn a trial of 11 HIV-1-infected subjects receiving methadone-maintenance therapy with 600 mg of ZIAGEN®twice daily (twice the currently recommended dose), oral methadone clearance increased[see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. This alteration will not result in a methadone dose modification in the majority of patients; however, an increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients.\nRiociguat\nCoadministration with fixed-dose abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine resulted in increased riociguat exposure, which may increase the risk of riociguat adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The riociguat dose may need to be reduced. See full prescribing information for ADEMPAS (riociguat).\n7.2 Lamivudine\nSorbitol\nCoadministration of single doses of lamivudine and sorbitol resulted in a sorbitol dose-dependent reduction in lamivudine exposures. When possible, avoid use of sorbitol-containing medicines with lamivudine-containing medicines[see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].\n7.3 Zidovudine\nAgents Antagonistic with Zidovudine\nConcomitant use of zidovudine with the following drugs should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship has been demonstratedin vitro:\nStavudineDoxorubicinNucleoside analogues, e.g., ribavirin\nHematologic/Bone Marrow Suppressive/Cytotoxic Agents\nCoadministration with the following drugs may increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine:\nGanciclovirInterferon alfaRibavirinOther bone marrow suppressive or cytotoxic agents\nDoes Abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine interact with my other drugs?\nEnter medications to view a detailed interaction report using ourDrug Interaction Checker.\n8. Use In Specific Populations\n8.1 Pregnancy\nPregnancy Exposure Registry\nThere is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) at 1-800-258-4263.\nRisk Summary\nAvailable data from the APR show no difference in the overall risk of birth defects for abacavir, lamivudine, or zidovudine compared with the background rate for birth defects of 2.7% in the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) reference population[see Data]. The APR uses the MACDP as the U.S. reference population for birth defects in the general population. The MACDP evaluates women and infants from a limited geographic area and does not include outcomes for births that occurred at less than 20 weeks' gestation. The rate of miscarriage is not reported in the APR. The estimated background rate of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies in the U.S. general population is 15% to 20%. The background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.\nHyperlactatemia, which may be due to mitochondrial dysfunction, has been reported in infants with in utero exposure to zidovudine-containing products. These events were transient and asymptomatic in most cases. There have been few reports of developmental delay, seizures, and other neurological disease. However, a causal relationship between these events and exposure to zidovudine-containing products in utero or peri-partum has not been established(see Data).\nIn animal reproduction studies, oral administration of abacavir to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in fetal malformations and other embryonic and fetal toxicities at exposures 35 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical daily dose. However, no adverse developmental effects were observed following oral administration of abacavir to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis, at exposures approximately 9 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose. Oral administration of lamivudine to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in embryolethality at systemic exposure (AUC) similar to the recommended clinical dose; however, no adverse development effects were observed with oral administration of lamivudine to pregnant rats during organogenesis at plasma concentrations (Cmax) 35 times the recommended clinical dose. Administration of oral zidovudine to female rats prior to mating and throughout gestation resulted in embryotoxicity at doses that produced systemic exposure (AUC) approximately 33 times higher than exposure at the recommended clinical dose. However, no embryotoxicity was observed after oral administration of zidovudine to pregnant rats during organogenesis at doses that produced systemic exposure (AUC) approximately 117 times higher than exposures at the recommended clinical dose. Administration of oral zidovudine to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in embryotoxicity at doses that produced systemic exposure (AUC) approximately 108 times higher than exposure at the recommended clinical dose. However, no embryotoxicity was observed at doses that produced systemic exposure (AUC) approximately 23 times higher than exposures at the recommended clinical dose(see Data).\nData\nHuman Data:\nAbacavir\nBased on prospective reports to the APR of  exposures to abacavir during pregnancy resulting in live births (including over 1,300 exposed in the first trimester and over 1,300 exposed in the second/third trimester), there was no difference between the overall risk of birth defects for abacavir compared with the background birth defect rate of 2.7% in a U.S. reference population of the MACDP. The prevalence of defects in live births was 3.2% (95% CI: 2.3% to 4.3%) following first trimester exposure to abacavir-containing regimens and 2.9% (95% CI: 2.1% to 4%) following second/third trimester exposure to abacavir-containing regimens.\nAbacavir has been shown to cross the placenta and concentrations in neonatal plasma at birth were essentially equal to those in maternal plasma at delivery[see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY(12.3)].\nLamivudine\nBased on prospective reports to the APR of of exposures to lamivudine during pregnancy resulting in live births (including over 5300 exposed in the first trimester and over 7,400 exposed in the second/third trimester), there was no difference between the overall risk of birth defects for lamivudine compared with the background birth defect rate of 2.7% in a U.S. reference population of the MACDP. The prevalence of birth defects in live births was 3.1% (95% CI: 2.7% to 3.6%) following first trimester exposure to lamivudine-containing regimens and 2.9% (95% CI: 2.5% to 3.3%) following second/third trimester exposure to lamivudine-containing regimens..\nLamivudine pharmacokinetics were studied in pregnant women during 2 clinical trials conducted in South Africa. The trials assessed pharmacokinetics in 16 women at 36 weeks' gestation using 150 mg lamivudine twice daily with zidovudine, 10 women at 38 weeks' gestation using 150 mg lamivudine twice daily with zidovudine, and 10 women at 38 weeks' gestation using lamivudine 300 mg twice daily without other antiretrovirals. These trials were not designed or powered to provide efficacy information. Lamivudine concentrations were generally similar in maternal, neonatal, and umbilical cord serum samples. In a subset of subjects, amniotic fluid specimens were collected following natural rupture of membranes and confirmed that lamivudine crosses the placenta in humans. Based on limited data at delivery, median (range) amniotic fluid concentrations of lamivudine were 3.9 (1.2 to 12.8)–fold greater compared with paired maternal serum concentration (n = 8).\nZidovudine\nBased on prospective reports to the APR of exposures to zidovudine during pregnancy resulting in live births (including over 4,200 exposed in the first trimester and over 9,700 exposed in the second/third trimester), there was no difference between the overall risk of birth defects for zidovudine compared with the background birth defect rate of 2.7% in a U.S. reference population of the MACDP. The prevalence of birth defects in live births was 3.2% (95% CI: 2.7% to 3.8%) following first trimester exposure to zidovudine-containing regimens and 2.8% (95% CI: 2.5% to 3.1%) following second/third trimester exposure to zidovudine-containing regimens.\nA randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in HIV-1-infected pregnant women to determine the utility of zidovudine for the prevention of maternal-fetal HIV-1 transmission. Zidovudine treatment during pregnancy reduced the rate of maternal-fetal HIV-1 transmission from 24.9% for infants born to placebo-treated mothers to 7.8% for infants born to mothers treated with zidovudine. There were no differences in pregnancy-related adverse events between the treatment groups. Of the 363 neonates that were evaluated, congenital abnormalities occurred with similar frequency between neonates born to mothers who received zidovudine and neonates born to mothers who received placebo. The observed abnormalities included problems in embryogenesis (prior to 14 weeks) or were recognized on ultrasound before or immediately after initiation of trial drug. See full prescribing information for RETROVIR®(zidovudine) and COMBIVIR®(lamivudine and zidovudine).\nZidovudine has been shown to cross the placenta and concentrations in neonatal plasma at birth were essentially equal to those in maternal plasma at delivery[see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY(12.3)].\nThere have been reports of mild, transient elevations in serum lactate levels, which may be due to mitochondrial dysfunction, in neonates and infants exposed in utero or peri-partum to zidovudine-containing products. There have been few reports of developmental delay, seizures, and other neurological disease. However, a causal relationship between these events and exposure to zidovudine-containing products in utero or peri-partum has not been established. The clinical relevance of transient elevations in serum lactate is unknown.\nAnimal Data:\nAbacavir\nAbacavir was administered orally to pregnant rats (at 100, 300, and 1,000 mg per kg per day) and rabbits (at 125, 350, or 700 mg per kg per day) during organogenesis (on Gestation Days 6 through 17 and 6 through 20, respectively). Fetal malformations (increased incidences of fetal anasarca and skeletal malformations) or developmental toxicity (decreased fetal body weight and crown-rump length) were observed in rats at doses up to 1,000 mg per kg per day, resulting in exposures approximately 35 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended daily dose. No developmental effects were observed in rats at 100 mg per kg per day, resulting in exposures (AUC) 3.5 times the human exposure at the recommended daily dose. In a fertility and early embryo-fetal development study conducted in rats (at 60, 160, or 500 mg per kg per day), embryonic and fetal toxicities (increased resorptions, decreased fetal body weights) or toxicities to the offspring (increased incidence of stillbirth and lower body weights) occurred at doses up to 500 mg per kg per day. No developmental effects were observed in rats at 60 mg per kg per day, resulting in exposures (AUC) approximately 4 times the human exposure at the recommended daily dose. Studies in pregnant rats showed that abacavir is transferred to the fetus through the placenta. In pregnant rabbits, no developmental toxicities and no increases in fetal malformations occurred at up to the highest dose evaluated, resulting in exposures (AUC) approximately 9 times the human exposure at the recommended dose.\nLamivudine\nLamivudine was administered orally to pregnant rats (at 90, 600, and 4,000 mg per kg per day) and rabbits (at 90, 300, and 1,000 mg per kg per day and at 15, 40, and 90 mg per kg per day) during organogenesis (on Gestation Days 7 through 16 [rat] and 8 through 20 [rabbit]). No evidence of fetal malformations due to lamivudine was observed in rats and rabbits at doses producing plasma concentrations (Cmax) approximately 35 times higher than human exposure at the recommended daily dose. Evidence of early embryolethality was seen in the rabbit at systemic exposures (AUC) similar to those observed in humans, but there was no indication of this effect in the rat at plasma concentrations (Cmax) 35 times higher than human exposure at the recommended daily dose. Studies in pregnant rats showed that lamivudine is transferred to the fetus through the placenta. In the fertility/pre-and postnatal development study in rats, lamivudine was administered orally at doses of 180, 900, and 4,000 mg per kg per day (from prior to mating through postnatal Day 20). In the study, development of the offspring, including fertility and reproductive performance, was not affected by maternal administration of lamivudine.\nZidovudine\nA study in pregnant rats (at 50, 150, or 450 mg per kg per day starting 26 days prior to mating through Gestation to postnatal Day 21) showed increased fetal resorptions at doses that produced systemic exposures (AUC) approximately 33 times higher than exposure at the recommended daily human dose (300 mg twice daily). However, in an oral embryo-fetal development study in rats (at 125, 250, or 500 mg per kg per day on Gestation Days 6 through 15), no fetal resorptions were observed at doses that produced systemic exposure (AUC) approximately 117 times higher than exposures at the recommended daily human dose. An oral embryo-fetal development study in rabbits (at 75, 150, or 500 mg per kg per day on gestation Days 6 through 18) showed increased fetal resorptions at the 500-mg-per-kg-per-day dose which produced systemic exposures (AUC) approximately 108 times higher than exposure at the recommended daily human dose; however, no fetal resorptions were noted at doses up to 150 mg per kg per day, which produced systemic exposure (AUC) approximately 23 times higher than exposures at the recommended daily human dose. These oral embryo-fetal development studies in the rat and rabbit revealed no evidence of fetal malformations with zidovudine. In another developmental toxicity study, pregnant rats (dosed at 3,000 mg per kg per day from Days 6 through 15 of gestation) showed marked maternal toxicity and an increased incidence of fetal malformations at exposures greater than 300 times the recommended daily human dose based on AUC. However, there were no signs of fetal malformations at doses up to 600 mg per kg per day.\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV-1-infected mothers in the United States not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV-1 infection. Abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine are present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Because of the potential for (1) HIV-1 transmission (in HIV-negative infants), (2) developing viral resistance (in HIV-positive infants), and (3) adverse reactions in a breastfed infant similar to those seen in adults, instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets.\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nAbacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablet is not recommended in children who weigh less than 40 kg because it is a fixed-dose tablet that cannot be adjusted for these patient populations[see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3)].\nTherapy-Experienced Pediatric Trial\nA randomized, double-blind trial, CNA3006, compared ZIAGEN®plus lamivudine and zidovudine versus lamivudine and zidovudine in pediatric subjects, most of whom were extensively pretreated with nucleoside analogue antiretroviral agents. Subjects in this trial had a limited response to abacavir.\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nClinical trials of abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, caution should be exercised in the administration of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets in elderly patients reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy[see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].\n8.6 Patients with Impaired Renal Function\nAbacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablet is not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance less than 50 mL per min because abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablet is a fixed-dose combination and the dosage of the individual components cannot be adjusted. If a dose reduction of the lamivudine or zidovudine components of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablet is required for patients with renal impairment then the individual components should be used[see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3), CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].\n8.7 Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function\nAbacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablet is a fixed-dose combination and the dosage of the individual components cannot be adjusted. If a dose reduction of abacavir, a component of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablet, is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), then the individual components should be used[see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].\nThe safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir have not been established in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment; therefore, abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets are contraindicated in these patients[see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)].\nZidovudine is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism and zidovudine concentrations are increased in patients with impaired hepatic function, which may increase the risk of hematologic toxicity. Frequent monitoring of hematologic toxicities is advised.\n10. Overdosage\nThere is no known specific treatment for overdose with abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. If overdose occurs, the patient should be monitored and standard supportive treatment applied as required.\nAbacavir\nIt is not known whether abacavir can be removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis.\nLamivudine\nBecause a negligible amount of lamivudine was removed via (4-hour) hemodialysis, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, and automated peritoneal dialysis, it is not known if continuous hemodialysis would provide clinical benefit in a lamivudine overdose event.\nZidovudine\nAcute overdoses of zidovudine have been reported in pediatric patients and adults. These involved exposures up to 50 grams. No specific symptoms or signs have been identified following acute overdosage with zidovudine apart from those listed as adverse events such as fatigue, headache, vomiting, and occasional reports of hematological disturbances. Patients recovered without permanent sequelae. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis appear to have a negligible effect on the removal of zidovudine, while elimination of its primary metabolite, 3′- azido-3′-deoxy-5′-O-β-D-glucopyranuronosylthymidine (GZDV), is enhanced.\n11. Abacavir, Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets Description\nAbacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets contain the following 3 synthetic nucleoside analogues: abacavir (ZIAGEN®), lamivudine (also known as EPIVIR®or 3TC), and zidovudine (also known as RETROVIR®, azidothymidine, or ZDV) with inhibitory activity against HIV-1.\nAbacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets are for oral administration. Each film-coated tablet contains the active ingredients 300 mg of abacavir as abacavir sulfate, 150 mg of lamivudine, and 300 mg of zidovudine, and the inactive ingredients crospovidone, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, and yellow ferric oxide. The tablets are coated with a film opadry green that is made of FD&C blue no. 2, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, talc, titanium dioxide and yellow ferric oxide.\nAbacavir Sulfate\nThe chemical name of abacavir sulfate is (1S,cis)-4-[2-amino-6-(cyclopropylamino)-9H-purin-9-yl]-2-cyclopentene-1-methanol sulfate (salt) (2:1). Abacavir sulfate is the enantiomer with1S,4Rabsolute configuration on the cyclopentene ring. It has a molecular formula of (C14H18N6O)2·H2SO4and a molecular weight of 670.74 g per mol. It has the following structural formula:\nAbacavir sulfate is a white to off-white powder and soluble in water. Dosages are expressed in terms of abacavir.\nLamivudine\nThe chemical name of lamivudine is (2R,cis)-4-amino-1-(2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-oxathiolan-5-yl)-(1H)-pyrimidin-2-one, 0.2 hydrate. Lamivudine is the (-) enantiomer of a dideoxy analogue of cytidine. Lamivudine has also been referred to as (-)2',3'-dideoxy, 3'-thiacytidine. It has a molecular formula of C8H11N3O3S·0.2H2O and a molecular weight of 232.86 g per mol. It has the following structural formula:\nLamivudine is a white to off-white solid and is soluble in water.\nZidovudine\nThe chemical name of zidovudine is 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine. It has a molecular formula of C10H13N5O4and a molecular weight of 267.24 g per mol. It has the following structural formula:\nZidovudine is a white to yellowish powder with a solubility of 20.1 mg/mL in water at 25°C.\n12. Abacavir, Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nAbacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablet is an antiretroviral agent[see Microbiology (12.4)].\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nPharmacokinetics in Adults\nIn a single-dose, 3-way crossover bioavailability trial of 1 abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablet versus 1 ZIAGENtablet (300 mg), 1 EPIVIR tablet (150 mg), plus 1 RETROVIR tablet (300 mg) administered simultaneously in healthy subjects (n = 24), there was no difference in the extent of absorption, as measured by the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximal peak concentration (Cmax), of all 3 components. One abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablet was bioequivalent to 1 ZIAGEN tablet (300 mg), 1 EPIVIR tablet (150 mg), plus 1 RETROVIR tablet (300 mg) following single-dose administration to fasting healthy subjects (n = 24).\nAbacavir:\nFollowing oral administration, abacavir is rapidly absorbed and extensively distributed. After oral administration of 300 mg of abacavir twice daily in 20 subjects, Cmax was 3.0 ± 0.89 mcg per mL (mean ± SD) and AUC(0 to 12 h) was 6.02 ± 1.73 mcg•hour per mL. Binding of abacavir to human plasma proteins is approximately 50% and was independent of concentration. Total blood and plasma drug-related radioactivity concentrations are identical, demonstrating that abacavir readily distributes into erythrocytes. The primary routes of elimination of abacavir are metabolism by alcohol dehydrogenase to form the 5′-carboxylic acid and glucuronyl transferase to form the 5′-glucuronide.\nLamivudine:\nFollowing oral administration, lamivudine is rapidly absorbed and extensively distributed. Binding to plasma protein is low. Approximately 70% of an intravenous dose of lamivudine is recovered as unchanged drug in the urine. Metabolism of lamivudine is a minor route of elimination. In humans, the only known metabolite is the trans-sulfoxide metabolite (approximately 5% of an oral dose after 12 hours).\nZidovudine:\nFollowing oral administration, zidovudine is rapidly absorbed and extensively distributed. Binding to plasma protein is low. Zidovudine is eliminated primarily by hepatic metabolism. The major metabolite of zidovudine is GZDV. GZDV AUC is about 3-fold greater than the zidovudine AUC. Urinary recovery of zidovudine and GZDV accounts for 14% and 74% of the dose following oral administration, respectively. A second metabolite, 3′-amino-3′  deoxythymidine (AMT), has been identified in plasma. The AMT AUC was one-fifth of the zidovudine AUC.\nIn humans, abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine are not significantly metabolized by CYP enzymes.\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine in fasting subjects are summarized in Table 3.\nEffect of Food on Absorption of Abacavir, Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets\nAdministration with food in a single-dose bioavailability trial resulted in lower Cmax, similar to results observed previously for the reference formulations. The average [90% CI] decrease in abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine Cmax was 32% [24% to 38%], 18% [10% to 25%], and 28% [13% to 40%], respectively, when administered with a high-fat meal, compared with administration under fasted conditions. Administration of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets with food did not alter the extent of abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine absorption (AUC), as compared with administration under fasted conditions (n = 24)[see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2)].\nSpecific Populations\nPatients with Renal Impairment:\nAbacavir, Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets\nThe effect of renal impairment on the combination of abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine has not been evaluated (see the U.S. prescribing information for the individual abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine components).\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment:\nAbacavir, Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets\nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the combination of abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine has not been evaluated (see the U.S. prescribing information for the individual abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine components).\nPregnant Women:\nAbacavir\nAbacavir pharmacokinetics were studied in 25 pregnant women during the last trimester of pregnancy receiving abacavir 300 mg twice daily. Abacavir exposure (AUC) during pregnancy was similar to those in postpartum and in HIV-infected non-pregnant historical controls. Consistent with passive diffusion of abacavir across the placenta, abacavir concentrations in neonatal plasma cord samples at birth were essentially equal to those in maternal plasma at delivery.\nLamivudine\nLamivudine pharmacokinetics were studied in 36 pregnant women during 2 clinical trials conducted in South Africa. Lamivudine pharmacokinetics in pregnant women were similar to those seen in non-pregnant adults and in postpartum women. Lamivudine concentrations were generally similar in maternal, neonatal, and umbilical cord serum samples.\nZidovudine\nZidovudine pharmacokinetics have been studied in a Phase 1 trial of 8 women during the last trimester of pregnancy. Zidovudine pharmacokinetics were similar to those of nonpregnant adults. Consistent with passive transmission of the drug across the placenta, zidovudine concentrations in neonatal plasma at birth were essentially equal to those in maternal plasma at delivery.\nAlthough data are limited, methadone maintenance therapy in 5 pregnant women did not appear to alter zidovudine pharmacokinetics.\nGeriatric Patients:\nThe pharmacokinetics of abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine have not been studied in subjects over 65 years of age.\nMale and Female Patients:\nThere are no significant or clinically relevant gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of the individual components (abacavir, lamivudine, or zidovudine) based on the available information that was analyzed for each of the individual components.\nRacial Groups:\nAbacavir and Lamivudine\nThere are no significant or clinically relevant racial differences in pharmacokinetics of abacavir or lamivudine based on the available information that was analyzed for each of the individual components.\nZidovudine\nThe pharmacokinetics of zidovudine with respect to race have not been determined.\nDrug Interaction Studies:\nThe drug interaction trials described were conducted with abacavir, lamivudine or zidovudine as single entities; no drug interaction trials have been conducted using abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. No clinically significant drug interactions are expected between abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine.\nEffect of Abacavir and Lamivudine on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Agents:\nIn vitro studies have shown that abacavir has potential to inhibit CYP1A1 and limited potential to inhibit metabolism mediated by CYP3A4. Lamivudine does not inhibit or induce CYP3A4. Abacavir and lamivudine do not inhibit or induce other CYP enzymes (such as CYP2C9, or CYP2D6). Based on in vitro study results, abacavir and lamivudine at therapeutic drug exposures are not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are substrates of the following transporters: organic anion transporter polypeptide (OATP)1B1/3, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) or P-glycoprotein (P-gp), organic cation transporter (OCT)1, OCT2, OCT3 (lamivudine only), or multidrug and toxic extrusion protein (MATE)1 and MATE2-K.\nRiociguat: Coadministration of a single dose of riociguat (0.5 mg) to HIV-1–infected subjects receiving fixed-dose abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine is reported to increase riociguat AUC(∞) compared with riociguat AUC(∞) reported in healthy subjects due to CYP1A1 inhibition by abacavir. The exact magnitude of increase in riociguat exposure has not been fully characterized based on findings from two studies [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].\nEffect of Other Agents on the Pharmacokinetics of Abacavir, Lamivudine, or Zidovudine:\nAbacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine are not significantly metabolized by CYP P450 enzymes; therefore, CYP enzyme inhibitors or inducers are not expected to affect their concentrations. In vitro, abacavir is not a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, MATE1, MATE2-K, multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)2 or MRP4; therefore, drugs that modulate these transporters are not expected to affect abacavir plasma concentrations. Abacavir is a substrate of BCRP and P-gp in vitro; however, considering its absolute bioavailability (83%), modulators of these transporters are unlikely to result in a clinically relevant impact on abacavir concentrations.\nLamivudine is a substrate of MATE1, MATE2-K, and OCT2 in vitro. Trimethoprim (an inhibitor of these drug transporters) has been shown to increase lamivudine plasma concentrations. This interaction is not considered clinically significant as no dose adjustment of lamivudine is needed.\nLamivudine is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP; however, considering its absolute bioavailability (87%), it is unlikely that these transporters play a significant role in the absorption of lamivudine. Therefore, coadministration of drugs that are inhibitors of these efflux transporters is unlikely to affect the disposition and elimination of lamivudine.\nGlucuronyl Transferase:\nDue to the common metabolic pathways of abacavir and zidovudine via glucuronyl transferase, 15 HIV-1-infected subjects were enrolled in a crossover trial evaluating single doses of abacavir (600 mg), lamivudine (150 mg), and zidovudine (300 mg) alone or in combination. Analysis showed no clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of abacavir with the addition of lamivudine or zidovudine or the combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. Lamivudine exposure (AUC decreased 15%) and zidovudine exposure (AUC increased 10%) did not show clinically relevant changes with concurrent abacavir.\nEthanol:\nAbacavir has no effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of ethanol. Ethanol decreases the elimination of abacavir causing an increase in overall exposure.\nInterferon Alfa:\nThere was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between lamivudine and interferon alfa in a trial of 19 healthy male subjects.\nMethadone:\nIn a trial of 11 HIV-1-infected subjects receiving methadone-maintenance therapy (40 mg and 90 mg daily), with 600 mg of abacavir twice daily (twice the currently recommended dose), oral methadone clearance increased 22% (90% CI: 6% to 42%)[see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1)]. The addition of methadone has no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir.\nRibavirin:\nIn vitrodata indicate ribavirin reduces phosphorylation of lamivudine, stavudine, and zidovudine. However, no pharmacokinetic (e.g., plasma concentrations or intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations) or pharmacodynamic (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) interaction was observed when ribavirin and lamivudine (n = 18), stavudine (n = 10), or zidovudine (n = 6) were coadministered as part of a multi-drug regimen to HIV-1/HCV co-infected subjects[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6)].\nSorbitol (Excipient):\nLamivudine and sorbitol solutions were coadministered to 16 healthy adult subjects in an open-label, randomized-sequence, 4-period, crossover trial. Each subject received a single 300-mg dose of lamivudine oral solution alone or coadministered with a single dose of 3.2 grams, 10.2 grams, or 13.4 grams of sorbitol in solution. Coadministration of lamivudine with sorbitol resulted in dose-dependent decreases of 20%, 39%, and 44% in the AUC(0-24); 14%, 32%, and 36% in the AUC(∞); and 28%, 52%, and 55% in the Cmax; of lamivudine, respectively.\nThe effects of other coadministered drugs on abacavir, lamivudine, or zidovudine are provided in Table 4.\n↑= Increase; ↓= Decrease; ↔= No significant change; AUC = Area under the concentration versus time curve; CI = Confidence interval.\n\n12.4 Microbiology\nMechanism of Action\nAbacavir:\nAbacavir is a carbocyclic synthetic nucleoside analogue. Abacavir is converted by cellular enzymes to the active metabolite, carbovir triphosphate (CBV-TP), an analogue of deoxyguanosine-5′-triphosphate (dGTP). CBV-TP inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) both by competing with the natural substrate dGTP and by its incorporation into viral DNA.\nLamivudine:\nLamivudine is a synthetic nucleoside analogue. Intracellularly, lamivudine is phosphorylated to its active 5′-triphosphate metabolite, lamivudine triphosphate (3TC-TP). The principal mode of action of 3TC-TP is inhibition of RT via DNA chain termination after incorporation of the nucleotide analogue.\nZidovudine:\nZidovudine is a synthetic nucleoside analogue. Intracellularly, zidovudine is phosphorylated to its active 5′-triphosphate metabolite, zidovudine triphosphate (ZDV-TP). The principal mode of action of ZDV-TP is inhibition of RT via DNA chain termination after incorporation of the nucleotide analogue.\nAntiviral Activity\nAbacavir:\nThe antiviral activity of abacavir against HIV-1 was assessed in a number of cell lines including primary monocytes/macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). EC50values ranged from 3.7 to 5.8 microM (1 microM = 0.28 mcg per mL) and 0.07 to 1.0 microM against HIV-1IIIBand HIV-1BaL, respectively, and the mean EC50value was 0.26+0.18 microM against 8 clinical isolates. The median EC50 values of abacavir were 344 nM (range: 14.8 to 676 nM), 16.9 nM (range: 5.9 to 27.9 nM), 8.1 nM (range: 1.5 to 16.7 nM), 356 nM (range: 35.7 to 396 nM), 105 nM (range: 28.1 to 168 nM), 47.6 nM (range: 5.2 to 200 nM), 51.4 nM (range: 7.1 to 177 nM), and 282 nM (range: 22.4 to 598 nM) against HIV-1 clades A-G and group O viruses (n = 3 except n = 2 for clade B), respectively. The EC50values against HIV-2 isolates (n = 4), ranged from 0.024 to 0.49 microM.\nLamivudine:\nThe antiviral activity of lamivudine against HIV-1 was assessed in a number of cell lines including monocytes and PBMCs using standard susceptibility assays. EC50values were in the range of 0.003 to 15 microM (1 microM = 0.23 mcg per mL). The median EC50values of lamivudine were 60 nM (range: 20 to 70 nM), 35 nM (range: 30 to 40 nM), 30 nM (range: 20 to 90 nM), 20 nM (range: 3 to 40 nM), 30 nM (range: 1 to 60 nM), 30 nM (range: 20 to 70 nM), 30 nM (range: 3 to 70 nM), and 30 nM (range: 20 to 90 nM) against HIV-1 clades A - G and group O viruses (n = 3 except n = 2 for clade B), respectively. The EC50values against HIV-2 isolates (n = 4) ranged from 0.003 to 0.120 microM in PBMCs. Ribavirin (50 microM) used in the treatment of chronic HCV infection decreased the anti-HIV-1 activity of lamivudine by 3.5-fold in MT-4 cells.\nZidovudine:\nThe antiviral activity of zidovudine against HIV-1 was assessed in a number of cell lines including monocytes and fresh human peripheral blood lymphocytes. The EC50 and EC90 values for zidovudine were 0.01 to 0.49 microM (1 microM = 0.27 mcg per mL) and 0.1 to 9 microM, respectively. HIV-1 from therapy-naive subjects with no amino acid substitutions associated with resistance gave median EC50 values of 0.011 microM (range: 0.005 to 0.110 microM) from Virco (n = 92 baseline samples) and 0.0017 microM (range: 0.006 to 0.0340 microM) from Monogram Biosciences (n = 135 baseline samples). The EC50 values of zidovudine against different HIV-1 clades (A-G) ranged from 0.00018 to 0.02 microM, and against HIV-2 isolates from 0.00049 to 0.004 microM. Ribavirin has been found to inhibit the phosphorylation of zidovudine in cell culture.\nNeither abacavir, lamivudine, nor zidovudine was antagonistic to tested anti-HIV agents, with the exception of stavudine where an antagonistic relationship with zidovudine has been demonstrated in cell culture. See full prescribing information for ZIAGEN (abacavir), EPIVIR (lamivudine), RETROVIR (zidovudine).\nResistance\nHIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to abacavir, lamivudine, or zidovudine have been selected in cell culture and were also recovered from subjects treated with abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine, or the combinations of the individual components.\nAbacavir and Lamivudine:\nHIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to the combination of abacavir and lamivudine have been selected in cell culture with amino acid substitutions, K65R, L74V, Y115F, and M184V/I emerging in HIV-1 RT. M184V or I substitutions resulted in high-level resistance to lamivudine and an approximately 2-fold decrease in susceptibility to abacavir. Substitutions K65R, L74M, or Y115F with M184V or I conferred a 7- to 8-fold reduction in abacavir susceptibility, and combinations of three substitutions were required to confer more than an 8-fold reduction in susceptibility.\nZidovudine:\nGenotypic analyses of the isolates selected in cell culture and recovered from zidovudine-treated subjects showed thymidine analogue mutation (TAM) substitutions in HIV-1 RT (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y or F, and K219E/R/H/Q/N) that confer zidovudine resistance. In general, higher levels of resistance were associated with a greater number of substitutions. In some subjects harboring zidovudine-resistant virus at baseline, phenotypic sensitivity to zidovudine was restored by 12 weeks of treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine.\nCross-Resistance\nCross-resistance has been observed among NRTIs. The combination of abacavir/lamivudine has demonstrated decreased susceptibility to viruses with a K65R substitution with or without an M184V/I substitution, viruses with L74V plus the M184V/I substitution, and viruses with TAM substitutions (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, K219 E/R/H/Q/N) plus M184V. An increasing number of TAMs is associated with a progressive reduction in abacavir susceptibility.\nTAMs are selected by zidovudine and confer cross-resistance to abacavir, didanosine, stavudine, and tenofovir. Cross-resistance between lamivudine and zidovudine has not been reported.\n13. Nonclinical Toxicology\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenicity\nAbacavir:\nAbacavir was administered orally at 3 dosage levels to separate groups of mice and rats in 2-year carcinogenicity studies. Results showed an increase in the incidence of malignant and non-malignant tumors. Malignant tumors occurred in the preputial gland of males and the clitoral gland of females of both species, and in the liver of female rats. In addition, non-malignant tumors also occurred in the liver and thyroid gland of female rats.  These observations were made at systemic exposures in the range of 6 to 32 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 600 mg.\nLamivudine:\nLong-term carcinogenicity studies with lamivudine in mice and rats showed no evidence of carcinogenic potential at exposures up to 10 times (mice) and 58 times (rats) the human exposures at the recommended dose of 300 mg.\nZidovudine:\nZidovudine was administered orally at 3 dosage levels to separate groups of mice and rats (60 females and 60 males in each group). Initial single daily doses were 30, 60, and 120 mg per kg per day in mice and 80, 220, and 600 mg per kg per day in rats. The doses in mice were reduced to 20, 30, and 40 mg per kg per day after Day 90 because of treatment-related anemia, whereas in rats only the high dose was reduced to 450 mg per kg per day on Day 91 and then to 300 mg per kg per day on Day 279.\nIn mice, 7 late-appearing (after 19 months) vaginal neoplasms (5 non-metastasizing squamous cell carcinomas, 1 squamous cell papilloma, and 1 squamous polyp) occurred in animals given the highest dose. One late-appearing squamous cell papilloma occurred in the vagina of a middle-dose animal. No vaginal tumors were found at the lowest dose.\nIn rats, 2 late-appearing (after 20 months), non-metastasizing vaginal squamous cell carcinomas occurred in animals given the highest dose. No vaginal tumors occurred at the low or middle dose in rats. No other drug-related tumors were observed in either sex of either species.\nAt doses that produced tumors in mice and rats, the estimated drug exposure (as measured by AUC) was approximately 3 times (mouse) and 24 times (rat) the estimated human exposure at the recommended therapeutic dose of 100 mg every 4 hours.\nIt is not known how predictive the results of rodent carcinogenicity studies may be for humans.\nTwo transplacental carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice. One study administered zidovudine at doses of 20 mg per kg per day or 40 mg per kg per day from gestation Day 10 through parturition and lactation with dosing continuing in offspring for 24 months postnatally. At these doses, exposures were approximately 3 times the estimated human exposure at the recommended doses. After 24 months at the 40-mg-per-kg-per-day dose, an increase in incidence of vaginal tumors was noted with no increase in tumors in the liver or lung or any other organ in either gender. These findings are consistent with results of the standard oral carcinogenicity study in mice, as described earlier. A second study administered zidovudine at maximum tolerated doses of 12.5 mg per day or 25 mg per day (approximately 1,000 mg per kg nonpregnant body weight or approximately 450 mg per kg of term body weight) to pregnant mice from Days 12 through 18 of gestation. There was an increase in the number of tumors in the lung, liver, and female reproductive tracts in the offspring of mice receiving the higher dose level of zidovudine.\nMutagenicity\nAbacavir:\nAbacavir induced chromosomal aberrations both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation in anin vitrocytogenetic study in human lymphocytes. Abacavir was mutagenic in the absence of metabolic activation, although it was not mutagenic in the presence of metabolic activation in an L5178Y mouse lymphoma assay. Abacavir was clastogenic in males and not clastogenic in females in anin vivomouse bone marrow micronucleus assay. Abacavir was not mutagenic in bacterial mutagenicity assays in the presence and absence of metabolic activation.\nLamivudine:\nLamivudine was mutagenic in an L5178Y mouse lymphoma assay and clastogenic in a cytogenetic assay using cultured human lymphocytes. Lamivudine was not mutagenic in a microbial mutagenicity assay, in anin vitrocell transformation assay, in a rat micronucleus test, in a rat bone marrow cytogenetic assay, and in an assay for unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat liver.\nZidovudine:\nZidovudine was mutagenic in an L5178Y mouse lymphoma assay, positive in anin vitrocell transformation assay, clastogenic in a cytogenetic assay using cultured human lymphocytes, and positive in mouse and rat micronucleus tests after repeated doses. It was negative in a cytogenetic study in rats given a single dose.\nImpairment of Fertility\nAbacavir:\nAbacavir did not affect male or female fertility in rats at a dose associated with exposures (AUC) approximately 3.3 times (male) or 4.1 times (female) those in humans at the clinically recommended dose.\nLamivudine:\nLamivudine did not affect male or female fertility in rats at doses up to 4,000 mg per kg per day, associated with concentrations approximately 42 times (male) or 63 times (female) higher than the concentrations (Cmax) in humans at the dose of 300 mg.\nZidovudine:\nZidovudine, administered to male and female rats at doses up to 450 mg per kg per day, which is 7 times the recommended adult dose (300 mg twice daily) based on body surface area, had no effect on fertility based on conception rates.\n13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology\nMyocardial degeneration was found in mice and rats following administration of abacavir for 2 years. The systemic exposures were equivalent to 7 to 24 times the expected systemic exposure in humans at a dose of 600 mg. The clinical relevance of this finding has not been determined.\n14. Clinical Studies\nThe following trial was conducted with the individual components of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablet[see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].\nCNA3005 was a multicenter, double-blind, controlled trial in which 562 HIV-1-infected, therapy-naive adults were randomized to receive either ZIAGEN (300 mg twice daily) plus COMBIVIR (lamivudine 150 mg/zidovudine 300 mg twice daily), or indinavir (800 mg 3 times a day) plus COMBIVIR twice daily. The trial was stratified at randomization by pre-entry plasma HIV-1 RNA 10,000 to 100,000 copies per mL and plasma HIV-1 RNA greater than 100,000 copies per mL. Trial participants were male (87%), Caucasian (73%), black (15%), and Hispanic (9%). At baseline the median age was 36 years; the median pretreatment CD4+ cell count was 360 cells per mm3, and median plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.8 log10 copies per mL. Proportions of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 400 copies per mL (using Roche AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITORTest) through 48 weeks of treatment are summarized in Table 5.\nTreatment response by plasma HIV-1 RNA strata is shown in Table 6.\nIn subjects with baseline viral load greater than 100,000 copies per mL, percentages of subjects with HIV-1 RNA levels less than 50 copies per mL were 31% in the group receiving abacavir vs. 45% in the group receiving indinavir.\nThrough Week 48, an overall mean increase in CD4+ cell count of about 150 cells per mm3 was observed in both treatment arms. Through Week 48, 9 subjects (3.4%) in the group receiving abacavir (6 CDC classification C events and 3 deaths) and 3 subjects (1.5%) in the group receiving indinavir (2 CDC classification C events and 1 death) experienced clinical disease progression.\n29 a Subjects achieved and maintained confirmed HIV-1 RNA less than 400 copies per mL.\n16.

Last updated on Feb 28, 2025.\nUsesSide effectsWarningsBefore takingWhat to avoidInteractionsFAQ\nWhat is Abecma?\nAbecma (idecabtagene vicleucel) is a CAR T-cell therapy used for treating relapsed or refractorymultiple myelomain certain adults. Abecma is a personalizedone-time infusionmade from a patient’s own white blood cells, which are genetically modified to recognize and attack multiple myeloma cells.\nAbecma FDA approvalwas granted for treating relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (rrMM) in adults who have received at least two prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent,proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody.\nAbecma's FDA approval was based on positive results from the clinical trialKarMMa-3 StudyAbecma patients had a success rate of:\n72% overall response rate (ORR)28% achieved a stringent complete response25% had a very good partial response19% achieved a partial response\n28% achieved a stringent complete response25% had a very good partial response19% achieved a partial response\nThese results highlight Abecma’s effectiveness in delaying disease progression in pre-treated multiple myeloma patients.\nHow Does Abecma Work?\nAbecma is a personalized immunotherapy designed to enhance the body's immune response against multiple myeloma. It utilizesgenetically engineered autologous T cellsto target and eliminate cancer cells. The process works as follows:\nGenetic Modification:The T cells are engineered in a laboratory to express achimeric antigen receptor (CAR), which specifically recognizesB-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), a protein found on multiple myeloma cells.CAR Activation & Targeting:Once infused back into the patient, these modified T cells seek out and bind to BCMA-expressing myeloma cells.Cancer Cell Destruction:Upon binding, the CAR T cells become activated, triggering an immune response that leads to the destruction of multiple myeloma cells through cytotoxic mechanisms.\nThis targeted approachenhances the immune system’s ability to attack multiple myeloma cells, potentially leading to prolonged remission for patients who have exhausted other treatment options.\nWhat is the Abecma treatment process?\nLeukapheresis: White blood cells are collected.Manufacturing Process: The infusion is created in a specialized lab (takes about 4 weeks).Pre-Infusion Chemotherapy: Patients receivethree daysof chemotherapy before Abecma infusion.Infusion: Abecma infusion is administeredtwo days after the completionof lymphodepleting chemotherapy. It is given as an intravenous infusion through a catheter (tube) placed into your vein.Premedication is given 30 to 60 minutes before infusion.Monitoring: Patients must remain at the treatment center for at least7 dayspost-infusion and within2 hours of the facility for 4 weeksfor safety monitoring.\nYour infusion may be delayed for up to 7 days if you have any of the following conditions:\nunresolved serious adverse events (especially pulmonary events, cardiac events, or hypotension), including those after preceding chemotherapies,active infections or inflammatory disorders.\nAbecma side effects\nCommon Abecma side effects\nCommon Abecma side effects may include:\ncytokine release syndrome- CRS (confusion, trouble breathing, fast or irregular heartbeats, feeling light-headed or very tired);headache, dizziness;problems with speech;low blood cell counts;fever, chills, tiredness, or other signs ofinfection;decreased appetite, severenauseaor diarrhea;pain in your bones, joints, or muscles;swelling anywhere in your body; orcold symptomssuch as stuffy nose, sneezing,sore throat,cough.\nSerious Abecma side effects:\nGet emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction: hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.\nA serious side effect of Abecma is called cytokine release syndrome (CRS).
